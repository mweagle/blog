## Experience

### Software Development Manager - AWS (2020 - 2023)

Software Development Manager for [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [AWS CodeCatalyst](https://codecatalyst.aws/explore).

* Contributed to [AWS Lambda SmartStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html) and [AWS Lambda response streaming](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-response-streaming/) capabilities.
* Defined and drove meetings, mechanisms and metrics to coordinate CI/CD for 100+ person development team spanning multiple organizations. The result of this work was increased visibility into per-component change/fail rates, regional deployment skew, and batch size. Metrics were automatically published as part of CI/CD execution and included standardized release note generation with commit history to reduce operational response time.
* Over the course of a year, doubled team size to increase capacity and reduce operational load.
* Managed decomposition of legacy `go` codebase into multiple, localhost `gRPC` microservices to align ownerhip, increase organizational velocity, and reduce response latency.
* Led the [Lambda Corection of Error Bar Raiser](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.coe.en.html) program to improve our incident documentation, learnings, and discussions.
* Delivered [GitHub Actions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/using-github-actions-with-amazon-codecatalyst/) on CodeCatalyst.
* Owned delivery of [CodeCatalyst Build](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/build-workflow-actions.html) and [CodeCatalyst Workflow Actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/workflows-actions.html).

The Flyte team (now [Union.AI](https://www.union.ai)) was responsible for providing a platform for 100,000+ workflow executions a month for business-critical workloads.

* Maximized team retention during organizational restructuring.
* Changed on-call and escalation policy to improve user experience, reduce on-call burden, and increase system feedback cycles.
* Prioritized observability work to facilitate more customer-facing transparency which allowed for greater self-service.
