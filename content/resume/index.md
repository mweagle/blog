## Experience

### Software Development Manager - AWS (2020-2023)

Software Development Manager for [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [AWS CodeCatalyst](https://codecatalyst.aws/explore).

* Contributed to [AWS Lambda SmartStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html) and [AWS Lambda response streaming](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-response-streaming/) capabilities.
* Defined and drove meetings, mechanisms, and metrics to coordinate CI/CD for 100+ person development team spanning multiple organizations. The result of this work was increased visibility into per-component change/fail rates, regional deployment skew, and batch size. Metrics were automatically published as part of CI/CD execution and emitted standardized release notes with full commit history to reduce operational response time.
* Over the course of a year, doubled team size to increase capacity and improve operational posture.
* Managed decomposition of legacy `go` codebase into multiple, localhost `gRPC` microservices to align ownership, increase organizational velocity, and reduce response latency.
* Led the [Lambda Correction of Error Bar Raiser](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.coe.en.html) program to improve our incident documentation, learnings, and discussions.
* Delivered [GitHub Actions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/using-github-actions-with-amazon-codecatalyst/) on CodeCatalyst,  [CodeCatalyst Build](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/build-workflow-actions.html), and [CodeCatalyst Workflow Actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/workflows-actions.html).

* Established funding for the team to replace legacy system with Spark-based pipelines for scalable, reliable, and cost-efficient training. Collaborated with team to migrate a near real-time system to a more durable and scalable solution using Kafka, [Flink](https://flink.apache.org/), [Druid](https://druid.apache.org/) and [Seldon](https://www.seldon.io/).
* Fostered a culture of learning, collaboration, and delivery.
* Mentored and coached within and across the team.
* Instituted [press release driven development](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/11/working_backwards.html) practices to clarify objectives and close accountability gaps.
* Conducted bi-weekly retrospectives to recognize accomplishments and discuss opportunitiesfor improvement.
* Cross-functionally collaborated with ML scientists to reduce downstream engineering integration costs.

The Flyte team (now [Union.AI](https://www.union.ai)) was responsible for providing a platform for 100,000+ workflow executions a month for business-critical workloads.

* Maximized team retention during organizational restructuring.
* Changed on-call and escalation policy to improve user experience, reduce on-call burden, and increase system feedback cycles.
* Prioritized observability work to facilitate more customer-facing transparency which allowed for greater self-service.
* Identified opportunities for systemic reliability improvements.

Successfully onboarded new team members to evolve and extend the core codebase. Accomplishments:

* Ensured all services expose Prometheus-compatible observability information.
* Created single fail-fast configuration initialization path with actionable error feedback.
* Developed integrations with Kafka, Kinesis, Kinesis Firehose, Minio, S3, Prometheus, Segment, GitHub, Vault, and other third-party services.
* Built superuser GUI in ReactJS to support authenticated BackOffice style operations and secure access to encrypted-at-rest customer assets.
* Initiated shared documentation build pipeline and infrastructure.
* Created shared, tagged, and structured logging interface.
* Collaborated with operations to ensure successful cluster-agnostic feasibility.
* Created initial E2E integration pipeline to ensure ongoing service compliance.
* Provided ongoing operational support.

### Engineering Manager - Adobe (2014-2015)

Led [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com) engineering team to deliver the *Adobe Creative Cloud Assets* presence. The team is responsible for building and supporting all service aspects from the DevOps/infrastructure layer to the business-logic microservices tier. All services are deployed to AWS across multiple accounts and geographies. In addition to supporting large-scale release events, lead a feature-flipper gated system that enabled continual product improvement. Accomplishments:

* Prioritized and managed the teamâ€™s technical roadmap.
* Migrated the platform services tier to Docker and etcd-backed configuration service. Migration occurred in tandem with CI/CD pipeline delivering multiple releases per day.
* Identified build-vs-buy opportunities and secured funding.

### Engineering Lead - Adobe (2012-2014)

Lead architect and developer for *Adobe Creative Cloud Assets* services tier. Accomplishments:
