The problem with uncertainty is that it can’t ever be reduced or eliminated. It's inescapable, lurking in the fractal crevices created by all prior attempts at its eradication.

What we can do is create certainty (or at least awareness) and feedback mechanisms. What do we need to do to deliver systems that are more transparent about expected behavior, unexpected behavior, and external conditions that are out of range?

Those constructive signals create information to help us navigate uncertainty rather than trying to reduce it.
