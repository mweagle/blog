I'm hiring a Senior EM to support and grow the Core Engineering Department at Splice. ğŸ‰ğŸ¶ğŸ“ˆ

The person in this role is responsible for foundational Splice infrastructure and services. Splice is fully distributed (US & UK eligible), youâ€™d report directly to me, and together we'd continue to build Splice's core engineering capacities. Looking forward to meeting you and please reach out via PM if I can provide more context.

â€œBy now I hope it's clear that panic() should be used sparingly and only when it really makes sense. Personally, probably about half of the codebases I work on don't call panic()at all, and even when they do, it's only in a few places.â€

â€œSeniors also recognize that understanding problems isnâ€™t just coming up with an algorithm. Itâ€™s understanding who wants the problem solved, why they want it solved, whoâ€™s paying for the problem to be solved, what parts of the problem have already been solved, what different kinds of solutions are possible, whether those solutions can be scaled or extendedâ€”and much more.â€
