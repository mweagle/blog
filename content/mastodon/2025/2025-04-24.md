"Most of it is just rebranded old ideas, overpriced software, or in the best-case scenario thin abstractions over things we've already been doing. In the worst case? Distractions that waste your time, burn your budget, and add complexity without delivering real value.”

"You’re not burned out because you’re weak.

You’re burned out because you’ve been relevant, valuable, over-functioning for too long—inside systems that reward your ability to endure dysfunction and call it leadership.”

"Many people tend to conflate empowerment and autonomy, or even use the terms interchangeably.

But when it comes to team topology, these are each important to consider separately.”

Following this thread, why would we need teams made up of designers and engineers? A lone PM could tell the agents to Just Do It. Even more, could the CEO bypass the PM entirely and tell the agents to "Write a defensible business plan for % YoY growth and build software to realize that plan"?

"Teams will likely include a PM, a designer, and an engineer. The engineer will be responsible for guiding hundreds or thousands of agents to build the software.”
