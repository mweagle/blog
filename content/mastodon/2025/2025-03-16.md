“Companies that strip out their middle management layer in the name of efficiency are not just cutting costs—they’re cutting their ability to adapt. Without slack, organizations become rigid.”

This expectation disincentivizes information sharing, especially leading indicators, if the manager sharing the information is expected to speak to *everything*. A team of 2-3 engineers solely working on a shared deliverable often can't speak to the current implementation because of asynchronous commits. Expecting a manager to do that as well, a person who isn't actively in the codebase every day, encourages command and control rather than innovation and impact.

"I expect you to know how everything works, insofar that if I asked you to show me how a feature works by tracing through the code, you could do it."

While content and code are produced by the same types of models, a huge difference is the lack of a content feedback cycle. Static content is distributed. Code is executed and (preferably) needs to accommodate change. The complexity is always in the feedback cycles, not the creation. Products that can predict the future have a much bigger opportunity than just creating code.

"Vibe coding is fun, but addressing the infinite number of edge cases in software is not. Very curious to see how products will address this in the future.”

“On one hand, the pursuit of simplicity is a bit of a “chasing perfection” thing, in that you can never get all the way there, and so there’s a risk of over-designing and second-guessing in ways that prevent you from ever shipping anything. But on the other hand, racing to release something with painful gaps can frustrate early customers and worse, it can put you in a spot where you have backloaded work that is more expensive to simplify it later.”

“Doing a brainstorm on a software design is still best done clustered around a whiteboard--I haven't found any online tool that's anywhere near as smooth as taking over a conference room with whiteboards, sticky notes, and pens.”
