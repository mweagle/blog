<p>“This regime is important, because it’s very hard to compose reliable end-to-end systems without knowing where the saturation points of components are, and how they perform beyond that point. Even if you try do things like rate limiting and throttling at the front door, which you should, you still need to know how much you can send, and what the backend looks like when it starts saturating.”<br /><a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2025/05/20/icpe.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">brooker.co.za/blog/2025/05/20/</span><span class="invisible">icpe.html</span></a></p>
