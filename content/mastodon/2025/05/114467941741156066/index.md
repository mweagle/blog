<p>To me this is a sign that the release was rushed. I have in partial jest claimed that the AWS Console (like all GUI consoles) is a complexity accelerant. The UX may have a lot of promise, but this gap is pretty hard to overlook.</p><p>&quot;At the moment of launch SageMaker Unified Studio doesn&#39;t have API, SDK or Cloudformation support so all the remaining steps of this guidance will be done from the console, once API support is added we will update the guidance to reflect it.&quot;</p><p><a href="https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-collaborative-unified-data-and-ai-development-on-aws" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">github.com/aws-solutions-libra</span><span class="invisible">ry-samples/guidance-for-collaborative-unified-data-and-ai-development-on-aws</span></a></p>
