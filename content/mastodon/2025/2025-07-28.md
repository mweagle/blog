“What does it mean to write software (software craft), how do we communicate (misunderstanding better), and what are we doing it all for (empowering people through IT).

“How much of the perceived speed increase of vibe coding actually comes from just not doing work? Production-quality software goes much further than the basic set of instructions that fulfills a specific task.”

“Nadella is trying to reconcile two seemingly contradictory realities: How can a company be “more successful than ever” while still eliminating jobs? His narrative framework attempts to make the brutal reality of our AI-driven future psychologically tolerable.”
