“Code assistance, in some ways, was the simplest problem to tackle first as opposed to other aspects of the SDLC.”

“Fortunately, execution tracing helped us pinpoint the problem. However, if we tried to use the execution tracer in a long-running server without the new flight-recording mode, it would likely amass a huge amount of execution trace data, which an operator would have to store, transmit, and sift through. The flight recorder gives us the power of hindsight. It lets us capture just what went wrong, after it’s already happened, and quickly zero in on the cause.”

I feel like I’ve read this general observation about work in controlled environments vs situated work for over a hundred years:

“But these positive indicators come with a major caveat. The studies were conducted in controlled environments where programmers completed isolated tasks — not in real-world settings, where software must be built atop complex existing systems.“

Page McConnell, Phish’s keyboardist with ~40 years of expertise, dropped his new “Something Will Land” album. He played every instrument in his studio.

First review giving big “I could build Slack in a weekend” vibes.

![“This album is pretty but also not that special really. I feel like anyone with a DAW and a couple VST's could make something like this in an afternoon.”](/mastodon/media/63355255f6434a0b.jpeg)
