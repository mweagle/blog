<p>“This idea that we&#39;ll automate what machines are good at and leave humans to do what humans are good at is a fairly old one, but still quite popular in many fields, including software. A problem is that it ignores the system of the human and computer working together, treating them as separate disregards the cognitive work of the human.”<br /><a href="https://resilienceroundup.com/issues/to-intervene-or-not-to-intervene-the-dilemma-of-management-by-exception/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">resilienceroundup.com/issues/t</span><span class="invisible">o-intervene-or-not-to-intervene-the-dilemma-of-management-by-exception/</span></a></p>
