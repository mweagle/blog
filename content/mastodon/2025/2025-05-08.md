Started a book club at work to read thorugh the excellent <https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-machine-learning/9781098107956/>.

“Model weights, decoding parameters, and prompts co-evolve.

The combinations of these artefacts must be versioned, tested, and rolled out with the same discipline we apply to traditional machine learning models, container images, or microservices.”
