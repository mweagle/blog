<p>Following this thread, why would we need teams made up of designers and engineers? A lone PM could tell the agents to Just Do It. Even more, could the CEO bypass the PM entirely and tell the agents to &quot;Write a defensible business plan for % YoY growth and build software to realize that plan&quot;? </p><p>&quot;Teams will likely include a PM, a designer, and an engineer. The engineer will be responsible for guiding hundreds or thousands of agents to build the software.‚Äù</p><p><a href="https://mikefisher.substack.com/p/the-impact-of-ai-on-software-development" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">mikefisher.substack.com/p/the-</span><span class="invisible">impact-of-ai-on-software-development</span></a></p>
