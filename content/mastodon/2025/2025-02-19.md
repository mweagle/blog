“This book proposes that the best way to tackle this challenge is by reframing software engineering as a decision-making process about systems that are too large for us to fully grasp. Furthermore, these systems exist in ever-changing environments.”

The illusion of synchronicity is tempting and often limiting.

Technologies aren’t eternal, one-time decisions. Serverless might be a good approach to securely reduce TTM, but not for predictable load seeking to optimize compute cost margins in a k8s shop. The synchronous model might be appealing at low traffic, but a bottleneck at 10x or 1000x traffic. The problem’s constraints shape the solution.

“Moreover, developers must learn how to handle asynchronous programming models, which complicate debugging and increase the learning curve associated with serverless.”

This is true of every technology and something early Serverless proponents emphasized. Another perspective is whether you can or should change the problem representation because that unlocks significant benefits.

“Now that the hype is over, we face facts: Serverless is a specific tool, suitable only for very specific use cases.”

“At the risk of saying the quiet part out loud, the way CEOs are talking about agents sure sounds like how they talk about employees—only cheaper!”
