“Observability 3.0 lets you answer questions you never could before. Do you want to dynamically inspect a tiny portion of your user population across arbitrary grouping by dimensions, without being forced to ingest all of that data ahead of time? Do you want to grab an on-demand P99.9 of the timing of a specific piece of code that might run thousands of times per second on each device? Do you want to get a full detailed log dump only when a specific sequence of events occurs? Observability 3.0 makes this possible.”
