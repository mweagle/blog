“They are not security experts, and a core principle in my own leadership philosophy is that I don’t want to make people responsible for areas in which they are not expert.”

Instead of asking “Why is it X” where X={slow, late, taking so long, unclear}, consider rephrasing as “What would it take to be Y?” where Y={faster, early, done sooner, more clear} .

The former invites defensiveness, counter factuals, anecdotes, and even if it could be answered, would still mean X is true. Sharp end of the work team members are particularly exposed to this form of questioning.

Invite constructive, solution-focused dialogue about how to get from X to Y. It’s likely you’ll surface information about X while people are discussing how to achieve Y.

How it started: “Why is the build slow?”

How it could go: “What is something we could do to make the build faster?”

This is why I typically recommend a *Glossary* section for every document. So much engineering misalignment stems from vocal agreement of different understandings of the same word.

“It's not that "no one knows what the hell an AI agent is", it's that everyone assumes that everyone else means what they mean, a bunch of it doesn't actually exist (yet?), and no one wants to start a conversation by defining it. “
