January 2nd, 2024: "I strongly suspect we will get more LLM generated rubbish in our Hackerone inboxes going forward." (Ref: <https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/01/02/the-i-in-llm-stands-for-intelligence/>)

May 5th, 2025: "We now ban every reporter INSTANTLY who submits reports we deem AI slop. A threshold has been reached. We are effectively being DDoSed. If we could, we would charge them for this waste of our time."

I agree that GenAI reliability entails new concepts and techniques. I also think there's much more in common with existing systems than not. Consistently asserting how every technology is a discontinuity severely limits our collective ability to learn.

"GenAI cloud services demand a new approach to reliability engineering. Traditional monitoring, triage, and mitigation processes aren’t enough."
