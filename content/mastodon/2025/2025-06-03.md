I’m starting to think we may already have reached this state after reading so many of these hyperbolic takes.

“The worry is that we, as a society, will become innumerate, not just illiterate.”

This seems so indisputable and yet is so contentious. The idea that everyone knows everything all the time doesn’t have a lot of supporting evidence. Although it does offer an elegant simplification.

“To believe that the LFI approach is worth doing, you need to believe that there is a whole bunch of things about the system that people don’t know, not just a single vulnerability. And there are some things that, say, Alice knows that Bob doesn’t, and that Alice doesn’t know that Bob doesn’t know.”

I’m skeptical that a web of embedded, ambient agents could ever operate as a collaborative, person-centered, and coordinated team. Each incentivized to push information, at increasing tempo, for engagement metrics. Agents from different vendors (or even different teams within a single vendor) working at cross purposes.

“Chatbots might have kicked off the era of conversational AI, but the revolution is in what comes after: ambient, embedded, invisible tools that behave more like teammates than software.”

“But something real is happening. My smartest friends are blowing it off. Maybe I persuade you. Probably I don’t. But we need to be done making space for bad arguments.”

“This idea that we'll automate what machines are good at and leave humans to do what humans are good at is a fairly old one, but still quite popular in many fields, including software. A problem is that it ignores the system of the human and computer working together, treating them as separate disregards the cognitive work of the human.”
