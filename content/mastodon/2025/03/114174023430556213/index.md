<p>This expectation disincentivizes information sharing, especially leading indicators, if the manager sharing the information is expected to speak to *everything*. A team of 2-3 engineers solely working on a shared deliverable often can&#39;t speak to the current implementation because of asynchronous commits. Expecting a manager to do that as well, a person who isn&#39;t actively in the codebase every day, encourages command and control rather than innovation and impact. </p><p>&quot;I expect you to know how everything works, insofar that if I asked you to show me how a feature works by tracing through the code, you could do it.&quot;</p><p><a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/growth/should-managers-still-code" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">theengineeringmanager.com/grow</span><span class="invisible">th/should-managers-still-code</span></a></p>
