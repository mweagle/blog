<p>Productionalization capacity is already stretched by current output. It’s also something that often “doesn’t have business impact” and can be immensely time consuming which hampers career development. I don’t see how this deep expertise will keep up as opportunities dwindle and vibing outputs increase. Why would an engineer want to spend time tracking down compiler flags when they could just vibe instead?</p><p>“Smart organizations will develop dual skillsets — rapid vibe coding for prototyping and proof-of-concepts, alongside rigorous engineering practices for production systems.”</p><p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/cracking-the-code-of-vibe-coding-124b9288e551" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">uxdesign.cc/cracking-the-code-</span><span class="invisible">of-vibe-coding-124b9288e551</span></a></p>
