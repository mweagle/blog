<p>I used to find this perspective more persuasive and emotionally satisfying until _finally_ finding the Cognitive Systems, Resiliency, and New View of Safety people. Systems are too non-linear and interconnected for deviations from desired behavior to be solely attributable to the most proximate individual‚Äôs deficiencies. Assigning fault has organizational utility, but it does not improve outcomes.</p><p>&quot;An absolutely critical part of every post-mortem is that it‚Äôs somebody‚Äôs fault.

<p>&quot;Treating &quot;error&quot; as technical inadequacy comparable to noise fails to understand the value of &quot;error&quot;. Paradoxically, it also blinds researchers to the workings of organizational portions of the sociotechnical system that give rise to accidents. It is not surprising that organizations continue to treat &quot;error&quot; as useful and objective. But this organizational behavior provides critical information about accidents that can be used to understand their genesis, evolution, and responses to them.‚Äù</p><p>Cook, Richard I., and Christopher P.
