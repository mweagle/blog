<p>While content and code are produced by the same types of models, a huge difference is the lack of a content feedback cycle. Static content is distributed. Code is executed and (preferably) needs to accommodate change. The complexity is always in the feedback cycles, not the creation. Products that can predict the future have a much bigger opportunity than just creating code. </p><p>&quot;Vibe coding is fun, but addressing the infinite number of edge cases in software is not. Very curious to see how products will address this in the future.‚Äù</p><p><a href="https://andrewchen.substack.com/p/predictionsthoughts-on-vibe-coding" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">andrewchen.substack.com/p/pred</span><span class="invisible">ictionsthoughts-on-vibe-coding</span></a></p>
