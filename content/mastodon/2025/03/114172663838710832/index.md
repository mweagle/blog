<p>“On one hand, the pursuit of simplicity is a bit of a “chasing perfection” thing, in that you can never get all the way there, and so there’s a risk of over-designing and second-guessing in ways that prevent you from ever shipping anything. But on the other hand, racing to release something with painful gaps can frustrate early customers and worse, it can put you in a spot where you have backloaded work that is more expensive to simplify it later.”</p><p><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2025/03/in-s3-simplicity-is-table-stakes.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">allthingsdistributed.com/2025/</span><span class="invisible">03/in-s3-simplicity-is-table-stakes.html</span></a></p>
