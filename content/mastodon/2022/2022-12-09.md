Some mantras I hear myself likely overusing

- Own the problem, not the solution

- People, Process, Ideas: in that order

- Outcomes over outputs

- Go slow to go fast

- There is no correct/performant way to do the wrong thing

- Communication is not coordination

- Make work visible

- Have you talked with them?
