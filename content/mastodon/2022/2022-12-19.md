“The overwhelming majority of human error-related outages involve ignored or inadequate procedures. Nearly 40% of organizations have suffered a major outage caused by human error over the past three years. Of these incidents, 85% stem from staff failing to follow procedures or from flaws in the processes and procedures themselves.”

“Where radar could augment existing approaches, as with fire control, it performed well. Where it stressed existing approaches, as it did with the need to make sense of battle, it did not perform well. To escape these limitations, the Navy had to acknowledge Conway’s Law, move beyond established organizational structures, and design a new “system” based on new communication patterns, especially aboard ship.”

“Revolution”: a fundamental change in political organization

NYT: “In other words, Mr. Musk has picked the right time to start a management revolution. Now, the question is: How many bosses will follow him into the fire?”

“And Twitter, like all systems at scale, is constantly in some state of degradation. In fact Twitter has 15 years of experience being in a state of partial degradation. 15 years is a long time to optimize for high availability in the face of degradation. This system was literally built for this. “
