This is the same reason I don’t support “Innovation Hackathons”. I’d prefer innovation be a steady state rather than a timeboxed activity. Hackathons who’s only purpose is togetherness/undirected individual exploration can be ok depending on the team.

"It appears that the structure of an organization has a huge effect on how people communicate with each other. This means that, no matter whether you are responsible for 5 or 500 people, you have to think about the form of your part of the organization. How do you give it a structure? How do you allow it to disseminate information? How do you influence the way people communicate and interact with each other?"
