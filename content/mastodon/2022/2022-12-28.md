“Managers restrict themselves to setting constraints, and they allow the performance systems in their team members to kick in and use their innate problem-solving potential. And besides, rules from management usually don’t get the job done anyway. After all, a reliable way to bring an organization to its knees is for people to do exactly what the rules tell them to do and nothing else”

“Specifically, we need a language to express application logic that enables compilers and language run times to efficiently exploit the capabilities of the plethora of hardware resources emerging across different parts of the hardware stack. At the same time, it would be an an interesting thought experiment to ponder how different would the hardware design of these devices be without the CPU-centrism in POSIX.”

“We need to think in organic structures and design with the capability to connect these organic structures via mechanistic edges. Conquering this paradigm, will unlock systems engineering of the future. We will never be able to design a perfect city.”

“What is the mass we’re moving? In software, it’s the system we’re changing and the social system we must change it in. The messier the code, the more coupling, the harder to deploy, the less familiar, the harder to see inside, the more people involved–the larger its mass.”

“A fellow engineer created a loose template doc for spikes and that was when inspiration struck. I recalled Gawande’s manifesto and realized that this was the perfect occasion for a checklist! I reflected on the pitfalls I had encountered before in our process and on the common tasks required for product experiments at Etsy…”

“The U.S. airline giant has no partnerships with other airlines to assist with rebookings, it operates with few open seats or backup crews and its unique flight patterns — running from destination to destination instead of in and out of certain hubs — leave little room for error, meaning delays can quickly spiral.”
