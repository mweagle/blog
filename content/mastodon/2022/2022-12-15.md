“Rollouts are an example of the need to think about orchestration, service discovery and load balancing in a holistic way. If we have a service with N instances, and we turn down and replace all of them with N other instances in a very short period of time — of the order of seconds, rather than minutes —  then in many cases, our systems will have problems, even if the new instances are ready and able to serve traffic.”

“The temptation with key results is to make them more about work performed than impact. If your key results are all about shipping systems, finishing projects, or hitting delivery milestones, you’re really just measuring whether or not you are getting done what you estimated you could get done. And that’s not bad, exactly, but it has two downsides.”
