<p>Some mantras I hear myself likely overusing</p><p>- Own the problem, not the solution<br />- People, Process, Ideas: in that order<br />- Outcomes over outputs<br />- Go slow to go fast<br />- There is no correct/performant way to do the wrong thing<br />- Communication is not coordination<br />- Make work visible<br />- Have you talked with them?</p>
