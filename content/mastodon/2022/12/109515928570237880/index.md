<p>“Rollouts are an example of the need to think about orchestration, service discovery and load balancing in a holistic way. If we have a service with N instances, and we turn down and replace all of them with N other instances in a very short period of time — of the order of seconds, rather than minutes —  then in many cases, our systems will have problems, even if the new instances are ready and able to serve traffic.”</p><p><a href="https://www.stanza.systems/post/why-health-checks-are-like-sidewalks" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">stanza.systems/post/why-health</span><span class="invisible">-checks-are-like-sidewalks</span></a></p>
