“But at higher levels, there’s just too much to spell it all out. It’s important to try, to define boundaries for that shape so you have some way to talk about them, but you can’t capture all of it in full detail. It relies on a mutual understanding about implied work.”

“The one thing I craved more than anything after getting laid off, even more than another job, was for someone to stand up and speak plainly, honestly, and frankly. That is my goal for this piece.

I don't know when this started, but releasing medical test records directly to patients without mediating through experts is not a good experience.
