â€œRemember that idea I had above, of incurring extra tech debt this year to keep the revenue growth rolling, and then planning to pay it off next year with the newer and bigger team? Yeah, that actually works... if you keep growing.â€

MFW my RSS reader nonchalantly shows me an article that equates developing AI to raising a childâ€¦then somehow folds in EQ, the consequences of Extraterrestrial life AI â€œbypassingâ€ humans to connect with human AI, and the transformative economic effects that Quantum AI will have on the worldâ€™s economyâ€¦

[@sewblue](https://sfba.social/@sewblue) Nice! Agree about steering clear of the core team - IME itâ€™s much easier to ask different/novel questions from an outsiderâ€™s perspective when you havenâ€™t been invested in the solution and acclimatized to the groupâ€™s way of thinking. Being able to ask those questions, late in a project, that elicits a constructive conversation is a skill in itself :)

I donâ€™t view those as dumb questions though - I think they speak to the need for diverse teams so that we cover more options.

â€œEven the detractors of American business tend to agree that companies are very good at sucking up profit opportunities, but here was a basic â€œtechnologyâ€ publicly available to everyone a decade a a half earlier, and it still took the most expensive consulting firm on the planet to help the largest retailers on the planet apply the basic principles that a ignorant 30-year old consultant could figure out over a weekend.â€
