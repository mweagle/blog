<p>I don&#39;t know who needs to hear this, but pressuring employees to work more hours isn&#39;t a productivity increase. It increases total input (time) and potentially increases (short-term) output. Sometimes this is the least-worst choice.</p><p>Increasing productivity means holding time spent constant and looking for opportunities to improve employee/team effectiveness. This is harder and takes longer.</p>
