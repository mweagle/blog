<p>Listening to this episode (<a href="https://preaccidentpodcast.podbean.com/e/safety-moment-the-power-of-no/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">preaccidentpodcast.podbean.com</span><span class="invisible">/e/safety-moment-the-power-of-no/</span></a>) I was reminded of a post-reorg “kickoff” meeting from years ago. </p><p>The message in that meeting was “never respond with no to an upper-level request”. It was a long meeting. There were suggestions for how to say no…without using the word no.</p><p>I started looking for a new role after that meeting.</p>

<p>There are times when “Yes, we could by shifting X with impact Y” or “Maybe - I’ll investigate trade offs and follow up” are good responses. Other times “No” is spot on.</p>
