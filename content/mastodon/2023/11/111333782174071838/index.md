<p>Managing by walking around is supposed to be a technique to surface communication gaps and help improve overall flow. It&#39;s not to institutionalize proximity bias as an evaluative performance criteria.</p><p>A lot of the RTO-hand wringing about managers being unhappy seem to boil down to:<br /> <br />* lack of remote-aware management training (Management is a completely *different* job than IC work.
