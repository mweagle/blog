Some might be in the early days of building their technology, but we're most definitely in the later millennia of human history.

There's a lot of good lessons to draw from that history.

For instance, stating that "we won't be a platform for racism".

If there is a rock in the highway, am I safer looking at the sign telling me there may be fallen rocks or avoiding the rock? If I take my eyes off the road to recognize the fallen rocks sign and miss seeing the rock in the road, was the sign helpful?

When there is an accident, hindsight chastising people for "not seeing the signs" doesn't create for safer passage. Consider investing in instruments to reduce the frequency of rocks on the road.

“The notion that it is easy to get ‘substantial gains’ through

computerisation is common in many fields. The implication

is that computerisation by itself reduces human error and

system breakdown. Any difficulties that are raised about the

computerisation process become mere details to be worked

out later.”

“Those pesky details turn out to be critical in whether the computerisation creates new forms of failure. New technology can help and can hurt, often at the same time depending on how the technology is used to support technical work in context…Improper computerisation can simply exacerbate or create new forms of complexity to plague operations….

People and computers are not separate and independent,but are interwoven into a distributed system that performs cognitive work in context.”
