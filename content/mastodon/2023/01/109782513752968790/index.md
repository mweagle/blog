<p>“In the software design team we studied, there was some relevant technical knowledge but little application domain knowledge, and customers were unclear on requirements. As a result, over 75% of the time devoted to the design phase of this project was spent in learning. Although the team had not learned everything it needed to know, time pressures forced it to move ahead with whatever knowledge it had gained.”</p>
