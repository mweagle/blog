<p>Happy to see 2023 kicking off with an emphasis on canceling ineffective meetings (access doesn&#39;t always imply action) and the benefits of a written/document culture. Written/document culture can be a powerful mechanism to build shared understanding, expose assumptions, and help new team members learn the Why behind the How.</p><p>However, what documents don&#39;t do is self-organize themselves. I&#39;ve found it helpful to provide scaffolding for those documents to be discoverable and temporally accurate.</p>

<p>Discovery: The lowest cost doc writing is &quot;Create New&quot; in whatever tool you&#39;re using. This typically creates a document with a semi-random, sometimes slug-including, URL in a flat space. Sometimes there are labels to logically group documents, assuming the author already knows the set of labels and their out-of-band definitions. I usually don&#39;t know the universe of labels and which are most betterer than other labels.</p><p>These documents are a thousand points of disconnected lights. Wire them up!</p>

<p>I proactively create a hierarchical virtual space to make it easier for related documents to be near each other. For instance, by project, by state (Archived, In Progress, Discarded), by YY/MM, etc. I spend some time trying to corral existing documents into that structure. I try to minimize the information discovery cost to a single event, rather than a series of ongoing searches in hopes we can find &quot;that design doc from last year that has all the information&quot;.</p>

<p>Temporally accurate: I&#39;ve found this to be a lot more challenging. In the process of corralling documents, I&#39;ve found documents with open comment threads, no comments (was it even reviewed?), and historical dates. This is all good information...or noise, depending on what actually happened.</p>

<p>I include an explicit metadata block that includes document status. Something like ADR documents: <a href="https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">github.com/joelparkerhenderson</span><span class="invisible">/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md</span></a>. Did the team chat about this and discard it, are we still talking about it (and if so, when did we do so last), is it a fantastic idea that is approved? Implemented? </p><p>I&#39;m still struggling with this one and I&#39;d like to learn more about ADLs (<a href="https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">github.com/joelparkerhenderson</span><span class="invisible">/architecture-decision-record</span></a>) in the real world to see if it could help.</p>

___

<p>TL;DR; Written/document culture is generally beneficial, supports asynchronous communication, and I&#39;ve found it to be more effective with additional structure.</p>
