â€œThe org tree carries implications of dependency by the ecosystem above, rather than power or status over those below.

The metaphor can produce visceral reactions from people who are smart enough to visualize an org tree in their head and are also subconsciously attached to the authority of the org chart.â€

Metaphors We Mistakenly Manage Byâ€¦

â€œBased on my observations, this narrative is strongest among people who do not really understand software and what it means to create software. To be a bit provocative: I think, it will be a lot easier to replace each highly paid manager who eagerly awaits to replace all their software developers than to replace the software developers they want to get rid of.â€

â€œWhen you hear â€œhuman errorâ€ as an explanation for why a system failed, you should think â€œthis person doesnâ€™t know how the system stays up.â€ Because without knowing how the system stays up, it is impossible to understand the cases where it comes down.â€

1.	Number of meetings

2.	Efficiency of meetings

3	When meetings are scheduled

Letâ€™s look at each of these.â€

â€œOn average, desk workers say the ideal amount of focus time is around four hours a day. More than two hours a day in meetings is the tipping point at which a majority of workers say theyâ€™re spending â€œtoo much timeâ€ in meetings, with a similar pattern emerging across all job levels.â€œ

â€œBut there was a catch. During his performance review, he learned that management had a metric for productivity: lines of code. Tom had negative productivity. In fact, because he was so successful, his entire group had negative productivity.â€
