<p>I think it’s reasonable to assume that every change (whether internal or external) could impact availability. I also agree that not all changes will receive equal preflight scrutiny because of ETTO. </p><p>However, it’s reasonable for all changes to (imperfectly) address how to gradually produce signal and how to undo if possible. This will also be incomplete, but shifts the default assumptions.</p>
