Is there a browser extension that answers the "We would like to send you notifications" page modal with a request that triggers a backend alarm that asks "I also would like to send you notifications".

[@webframp](https://hachyderm.io/@webframp) Nice. This targets  C4 only - there are a *lot* of params (<https://github.com/mweagle/C4-PlantUML-Themes/blob/b9514b69b1b6e00753e453ec5008942ff066b8dd/resources/skinparams.txt>) that may need to be updated depending on what type of diagrams you're creating with Mermaid (which is great).

For JS rendering similar to Mermaid, TAL at <https://github.com/mweagle/blog/blob/main/static/js/shortcodes/plantuml/rawdeflate.js> and the Hugo shortcode at <https://github.com/mweagle/blog/blob/main/layouts/shortcodes/plantuml.html>

HTH.
