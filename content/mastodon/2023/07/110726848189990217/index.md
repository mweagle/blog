<p>“Loads of folks were talking about emergent system properties like metastability. Unfortunately, not a lot of folks seem to be writing papers about it, or getting grants to work on it...Metastable failures in distributed systems and Metastable Failures in the Wild are some of the most important systems work of the last few years, in my opinion. There&#39;s a lot more to do here.”</p><p><a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2023/07/13/osdi.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">brooker.co.za/blog/2023/07/13/</span><span class="invisible">osdi.html</span></a></p>
