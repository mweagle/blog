<p>“As a rule of thumb, though, good managers don’t attempt to cause growth by force. They take individual experience as both motivation and input, then shape healthy experiences by exerting force on the environment. Let me repeat: good managers usually frame their work as being most on structures, not directly on people.”</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@ElizAyer/annual-performance-reviews-ruin-everything-7464e07dff3a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">medium.com/@ElizAyer/annual-pe</span><span class="invisible">rformance-reviews-ruin-everything-7464e07dff3a</span></a></p>

<p>“Performance reviews, by refusing to acknowledge the role of context, allow bad systems to persist, tacitly conveying that the wider system is inevitable and must be accepted. Reviews often correctly diagnose challenges, but put responsibility inappropriately back on an individual, blaming them for their own marginalization or ineffectiveness. They take a person’s failure to be heard and give advice that they could have communicated better.”</p>
