<p>“Similar to the assertion that developers are human, the assertion that software engineering work is nonlinear and unpredictable is often met with agreement. But again, we see attempts to simplify engineering work to make the problem of engineering productivity more tractable. “</p><p>Jaspan, Ciera, and Collin Green. 2023. “A Human-Centered Approach to Developer Productivity.” IEEE Software 40 (1): 23–28.</p>
