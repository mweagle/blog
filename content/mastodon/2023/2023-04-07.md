“But many real-world processes, like the ones that Andy talks about, are not Poisson. They behave much worse, with much higher spikes and much more autocorrelation than Poisson processes would exhibit. This isn't some kind of numerical anomaly, but rather a simple observation about the world: traffic changes with time and use.”

“This created a huge incentive to get very good at moving the important numbers.

For the most part, the way you move these numbers is by shipping some kind of change to the product. In my experience, these changes tend to fall into one of three areas: Innovate, Iterate, or Compete.”

“Principles

A bunch of folks are making changes to the same system. In what order & at what granularity should they separate, work, & integrate?”

“This article argues that from film to fashion and architecture to advertising, creative fields have become dominated and defined by convention and cliché. Distinctiveness has died. In every field we look at, we find that everything looks the same.

Welcome to the age of average.”

“Slack is the policy of deliberately leaving time that isn't allocated for stories, using that time for unplanned work. Although this seems inefficient, it usually yields a significant improvement for the productivity of a team.”

“How do we do this same activity at scale? How do create significant structures to understand and evaluate the transformations that unfold as they unfold and feed those back into the development cycle? How do we build assessment protocols for evaluating new AI models?”
