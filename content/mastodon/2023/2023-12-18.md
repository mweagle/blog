“It is undeniable that developer’s ability to instantaneously ask questions of a non-judgmental AI assistant that will give answers in context is going to have a marked negative impact on the usefulness of the public datasets provided by Stack Overflow.”

Automation has a tendency to demand more cognitive resources from people exactly when people have fewer resources to spend tending to the automation. I’ve been on many incident calls where shared thoughts/hypotheses are interrupted by a need to shush the alert storm.

“Clumsy automation happens when a human cannot coordinate very well with a machine and as a result, the machine or system is only really useful during periods of low demand or a calm workload.”

Not sure what training data these AIOps tools might use, but :take_my_money.gif: if there’s a way to continually verify that chained RPC calls have monotonic timeouts configured.

“Your job, therefore, is to create more compelling reasons to connect. The only true compelling reason is that both you and your peers are getting something valuable out of the relationship.”

While this article focuses on more on techniques when moving from IC to senior/staff, a similar principle applies to improving IC effectiveness:

“For many years I have been systematically identifying error-prone programming habits — by reviewing the literature, analyzing other people’s mistakes, and analyzing my own mistakes — and redesigning my programming environment to eliminate those habits.”

This conflation is also seen in the “Fail Fast” mantra (<https://preaccidentpodcast.podbean.com/e/papod-474-failing-fast/>).
