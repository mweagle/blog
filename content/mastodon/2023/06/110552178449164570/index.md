<p>“To make sure that learning is sustained over a long time period, one needs to make sure that access to the original data source is preserved and that additional data not generated by LLMs remain available over time. The need to distinguish data generated by LLMs from other data raises questions around the provenance of content that is crawled from the Internet: it is unclear how content generated by LLMs can be tracked at scale.”</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17493v2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="">arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17493v2.pdf</span><span class="invisible"></span></a></p>
