"A productive knowledge worker is one who enjoys and is enthusiastic about their work, finds meaning and purpose in their work, is not continuously stressed, is appreciated, has a work-life balance, finds the work atmosphere pleasant, and resolves conflicts with co-workers quickly. This suggests that the famous 80-hour workweek developer is not a productive developer."

Started using <https://paperpile.com> to manage PDFs. I was saving them to Dropbox + marking up with PDF Expert (which is great).

The UI is minimal, but the ability to easily add papers by title is really nice.

First friction point: I can download PDFs on iOS, but I can’t deeplink to the hosted paper source when sharing.

And source citations are voracious character consumers. Example:

Ko, Amy J. 2019. “Individual, Team, Organization, and Market: Four Lenses of Productivity.” In Rethinking Productivity in Software Engineering, edited by Caitlin Sadowski and Thomas Zimmermann, 49–55. Berkeley, CA: Apress.

“It’s almost gotten to be boring, the degree to which people believe that what they refer to as “free speech” should not only allow them to say whatever they want (which it does), but should also prevent other people from understanding them to be the sort of person who says those things.”
