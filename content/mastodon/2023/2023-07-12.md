“The sheer fact that “Big Ball” is a nebulous, plastic metaphor has enabled almost any methodology or architecture that fell out of favor over the past quarter-century, to become associated with it.

Rather than thinking only about counterfactuals and seeking only to avoid that things go wrong, Safety-II involves thinking about work-as-actually-done, and how to ensure that things go right. This means we have to ask “what is right for us (at this time)?”, i.e. what matters to us and what are our goals?”

“Which leads to the hardest question actually, turns out, how do we define what coordination is? That's where Ameloot's proof is really brilliant. He shows that the way to think about coordination is, there are the messages that we have to wait for, even if it turns out we have all the data.”
