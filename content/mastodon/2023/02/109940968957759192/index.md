<p>“The tech industry suffers from a deep association of work with individual productive toil, and that just isn’t what knowledge work is. In addition to being social, knowledge work is also uncertain and messy. Moreover, it’s hard to make knowledge production happen reliably. There are better and worse ways, but in general, meaning-making argues with agendas and likes to break through timeboxes.“</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@ElizAyer/meetings-are-the-work-9e429dde6aa3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">medium.com/@ElizAyer/meetings-</span><span class="invisible">are-the-work-9e429dde6aa3</span></a></p>
