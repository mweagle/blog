<p>Started using <a href="https://paperpile.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="">paperpile.com</span><span class="invisible"></span></a> to manage PDFs. I was saving them to Dropbox + marking up with PDF Expert (which is great).</p><p>The UI is minimal, but the ability to easily add papers by title is really nice.</p>

<p>And source citations are voracious character consumers. Example:</p><p>Ko, Amy J. 2019. “Individual, Team, Organization, and Market: Four Lenses of Productivity.” In Rethinking Productivity in Software Engineering, edited by Caitlin Sadowski and Thomas Zimmermann, 49–55. Berkeley, CA: Apress.</p>
