<p>‚ÄúOccasionally I am called upon to review the progress of other software design efforts. My first step is to investigate the state of the documentation. If the documentation is in serious default my first recommendation is simple. Replace project management. Stop all activities not related to documentation. Bring the documentation up to acceptable standards. Management of software is simply impossible withouta very high degree of documentation.‚Äú</p><p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/41765.41801" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/41765.4</span><span class="invisible">1801</span></a></p>

<p>&quot;After documentation, the second most important criterion for success revolves around whether the product is totally original. If the computer program in question is being developed for the first time, arrange matters so that the version finally delivered to the customer for operational deployment is actually the second version insofar as critical design/operations areas are concerned.&quot;</p>
