<p>‚ÄúWe should regard best practices as provisional, not optimal, as a floor rather than a ceiling. When we label an approach a best practice, it tends to become a ceiling that is hard to change even as more knowledge is gained. Instead, we can identify provisional best practices that serve as a floor while learning goes forward. It is a move from ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù to ‚Äúbetter practices‚Äù that frees us from undocumented anecdotal approaches and forces a commitment to continual improvement.‚Äù</p>
