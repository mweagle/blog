<p>That &quot;Machines will be much better at estimating JIRA ticket resolution times than humans&quot; is quite a take. </p><p>I mean if they could do that, wouldn&#39;t we just ask &quot;AI&quot; to  in natural language to &quot;make the service do X&quot; and eliminate the entire ticketing process? Why even create tickets? Just submit voice commands directly.</p><p>Much of my EM time is spent understanding what&#39;s _not_ in the description or connecting that to other non-existent but potential work. Literally non-existent training data.</p>
