<p>“Often the justification for rewrites like this is “developer productivity.” As a believer in developer productivity, I think this is a fine motivation, but there need to be measures behind that intuition that you can point to. “We need to make it possible to ship the code base to production on demand” is a much more compelling and clear project than “we need to rewrite this system to increase developer productivity.””</p><p><a href="https://skamille.medium.com/avoiding-the-rewrite-trap-b1283b8dd39e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">skamille.medium.com/avoiding-t</span><span class="invisible">he-rewrite-trap-b1283b8dd39e</span></a></p>
