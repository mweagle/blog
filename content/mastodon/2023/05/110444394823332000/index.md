<p>“Approximately 80% of newly uploaded Lambda functions result in zero unique chunks, and are just re-uploads of images that had been uploaded in the past. This appears to be primarily driven by automated testing and deployment (CI/CD) systems. Of the remaining 20% of functions that create at least one unique chunk (and therefore aren’t just trivial reuploads), the mean upload contains 4.3% unique chunks, and the median 2.5% unique chunks”</p>
