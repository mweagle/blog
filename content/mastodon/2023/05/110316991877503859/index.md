<p>I don&#39;t know who needs to hear this, but there is no &quot;magical perfect architecture/system&quot; that is universally applicable for all organizations and workloads for all time which concurrently optimizes for cost, DX, security, velocity, reliability, extensibility, and optionality. </p><p>There are local decisions, constrained by path dependencies and decisions made under uncertainty with deadlines.</p><p>The only system that can avoid adaptation is the one that doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>This is a much more eloquent take on the importance of designing evolvable architectures.</p><p>‚ÄúHowever, I want to reiterate, that there is not one architectural pattern to rule them all. How you choose to develop, deploy, and manage services will always be driven by the product you‚Äôre designing, the skillset of the team building it, and the experience you want to deliver to customers (and of course things like cost, speed, and resiliency).‚Äù</p><p><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2023/05/monoliths-are-not-dinosaurs.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">allthingsdistributed.com/2023/</span><span class="invisible">05/monoliths-are-not-dinosaurs.html</span></a></p>
