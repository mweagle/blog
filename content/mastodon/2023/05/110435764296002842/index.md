<p>Summary notes for &quot;Resilience is a Verb&quot;</p><p>TL;DR: Resilience is better thought of in terms of a system&#39;s potential capacity, rather than a state to be achieved.

<p>One way I try to keep this in mind is to imagine before the system existed. All was effectively &quot;failure to produce desired outcomes&quot;. People worked together to co-create the illussion of stability.</p><p>And since conditions, tempo, and scale have always changing, there&#39;s never been a point where the system switched from continual co-creation to pre-existing truth.</p>
