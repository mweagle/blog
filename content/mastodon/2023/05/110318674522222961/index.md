What costs are associated with this research direction and what should we consider<br />before pursuing it? Do the field of NLP or the public that it serves in fact need larger LMs? If so, how can we pursue this research direction while mitigating its associated risks? If not, what do we need instead?”</p><p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">doi.org/10.1145/3442188.344592</span><span class="invisible">2</span></a>.</p>
