True.

“Which means that managers are incentivized to get headcount. Yes, that does often mean demonstrating competence, but it's competence for headcount justification, instead of delivery or customer results.”

I’m not a fan of reframing “learning and adjusting” as “wrong and now corrected”. Also, AWS is quite large. I’m pretty sure there are still microservices in there somewhere.

“With the recent blog post from AWS saying they have ditched microservices and returned to the monolith, the old war of monolith vs. microservices has reignited.”

“The quality of documentation of a product can be considered as a barometer of the developer’s empathy. However it remains one of the most ignored parts of the software world.”

“To me, this is a pretty stunning illustration of what’s going on in today’s workplace: you have a whole bunch of people who feel like they’re just as productive if not more so than before….and then a whole bunch of managers and leaders who feel in the dark about what their teams are doing.”

“Via our empirical studies, we find that the presence of potential bugs drastically degrades the code-completion performance of high-performing Code-LLMs, with test-case pass rates dropping to below 5% across both datasets for all tested model variants.“

Constraints are critical to insight, which then enables simplicity (or at least stability).

“That goal led us to some challenging design constraints. Interestingly, those constraints led us in the direction of simplicity rather than complexity: they caused us to choose general mechanisms (background key exchange, lattice compositions) that work well across scale points.“
