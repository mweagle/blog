[Team]Work as done: 1993 edition.

â€œThese observations, however, are less surprising if we acknowledge the criticality of knowledge acquisition, sharing, and integration activities. Adopting a knowledge perspective leads to some specific recommendations for managers of software design efforts.â€

â€œIn the software design team we studied, there was some relevant technical knowledge but little application domain knowledge, and customers were unclear on requirements. As a result, over 75% of the time devoted to the design phase of this project was spent in learning. Although the team had not learned everything it needed to know, time pressures forced it to move ahead with whatever knowledge it had gained.â€

â€œGenerally speaking, any mechanism that can help teams copeâ€”for example, communicate more efï¬ciently or reduce the need to communicate, anticipate and explain events and member actions, learn who knows what or where to ï¬nd expertise, ï¬gure out who did what and when on particular task activities, and who is aroundâ€”has the potential to offset some of the coordination problems. We expect this to be true for both collocated and geographically distributed collaboration.â€

Similar shared space/ambient signals lost to automated systems: â€œNotice how much of the knowledge discussed here is available at relatively low cost in â€œopenâ€ work environments involving multiple human agents. For example, in older, hardwired control centers, individual controllers can often infer what other controllers are working on just by observing which displays or control panels they are attending to.â€

In Slack, nobody can see your over the ear headphones.

From the first article, although I wonder if this is because there is/was no other forum for serendipity. Saying â€œthe water cooler was brokenâ€ would be an interesting discussion starter for project retro.

â€œFurthermore, studies have shown that a substantial amount of coordination in software development takes place through informal encounters and meetings in public places such as the water cooler or coffee room [47, 63], which does not happen when members are separated by distance.â€

Alternatively, sometimes the most important component is the one no one has ever recognized: â€œAnd they realized: Irving & his trip was the missing secret ingredientâ€

â€œMany of these tasks donâ€™t make it onto the roadmap, because when I look at the overhead of creating a ticket, discussing it in planning, advocating for itâ€“then I canâ€™t. It isnâ€™t worth that. I canâ€™t justify any particular one.â€
