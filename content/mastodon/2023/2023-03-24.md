There will be a _lot_ of jobs in those spaces.

I think they are using "technical debt" as a synonym for "underproduction" due to barriers to entry. When I think about LLM-code in production, that is definitely not the technical debt I'm thinking about.

LLMs optimize for the part of "production" that's easiest to see (the typed code), rather than the processes that led to the person understanding why that code would have solved their issue.

“We do think, however, that software cannot reach its fullest potential without escaping the shackles of the software industry, with its high costs, and, yes, relatively low productivity. A software industry where anyone can write software, can do it for pennies, and can do it as easily as speaking or writing text, is a transformative moment.”
