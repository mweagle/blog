Hot leadership take: using evaluative language in level descriptions ("good" documentation, "persuasive" slide deck) is more effective when paired with a concrete example that can be deconstructed together.

What makes the documentation good? What makes the communication persuasive?

General guidelines are helpful & those should be illustrated with an actual example from inside the organization. The exemplar will change over time, but should be anchored in stable principles.

“Write it better" isn't constructive.

"I'd suggest adding sections to address X, Y, and Z...Take a look at this other artifact for ideas on how to present that information" is more helpful.

If there is no example, then that’s probably a signal to create one so that the evaluative language can be calibrated.
