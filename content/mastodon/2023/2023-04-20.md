These observations aged well..

"Three factors, however, set research and development programming apart. First, we are attempting to schedule intellectual activity as well as the more easily measurable physical activity. Second, by definition, research and development projects are of a pioneering nature. Therefore previous, parallel experience upon which to base schedules of a new project is relatively unavailable...

Third, the unpredictability of specific research results inevitably requires, frequent change in program detail. These points are acknowledged by all experienced research people."

"Yet, even though it be ridiculous to conceive of scheduling research and development with the split-second precision of an auto assembly line, it is clear that the farther reaching and more complex our projects become, the greater is the need for procedural tools to aid top managers to comprehend and control the project."

"This last point introduces a most important matter in research administration. The people most qualified to speak on what they have done, are doing, can do, and might do in a development project are the development people themselves. "

This is wild...

"Our overall research goal is to build a prediction system that takes as input the title and description of an issue and produces a story-point estimate for the issue."

What was the training set?

"To collect data for our dataset, we looked for issues that were estimated with story points. JIRA is one of the few widely-used issue tracking systems that support agile development (and thus story point estimation) with its JIRA Agile plugin. Hence, we selected a diverse collection of nine major open source repositories that use the JIRA issue tracking system: Apache, Appcelerator, DuraSpace, Atlassian, Moodle, Lsstcorp, MuleSoft, Spring, and Talendforge."
