“He admonished managers to remove the barriers that robbed people of pride in their work. Deming believed—and study after study supports his belief—that, in general, people want to do good work.

Deming said quality isn’t so much about improving the product as it is about improving the process.”

“Slack and email are async, not sync, tools: Email and, increasingly, Slack are not well-loved tools because they are often ineffectively used as synchronous, interrupt-driven tools requiring an immediate response.”
