<p>If I can’t define an agenda (with time blocks) <br />and a set of questions I would like to answer in a meeting…I’m not ready to schedule a meeting. </p><p>“Why Are We Here?

It’s nefarious; it’s just.. confusing and agenda-less.”</p><p><a href="https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-seven-meetings-you-hate/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">randsinrepose.com/archives/the</span><span class="invisible">-seven-meetings-you-hate/</span></a></p>
