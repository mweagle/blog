<p>“Managerial roles are usually held by people who previously held the roles below them, did pretty well in those roles, and now capture even more compensation for telling subordinates what to do. Yet when one gets this reward, they are often disappointed that life is not what it appeared to be. Your new, allegedly better job is rarely easier. Mostly it’s just different.”</p><p><a href="https://figuregrounds.substack.com/p/your-view-of-management-is-upside" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">figuregrounds.substack.com/p/y</span><span class="invisible">our-view-of-management-is-upside</span></a></p>
