<p>“For Kuhn, the problems with unrestricted readership were exposed most clearly when it came to the notions of the paradigm and the paradigm shift. The philosophers’ criticisms he considered legitimate….But paradigms-gone-wild in the culture also bothered him; he complained that he had ‘totally lost control’ of the term’s proper usage, and vowed that in future he would ‘seldom’ use it.”<br /><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v45/n07/steven-shapin/paradigms-gone-wild" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v45/n07/st</span><span class="invisible">even-shapin/paradigms-gone-wild</span></a></p>
