“How do systems create partial order so they can minimize their coordination?   This section will discuss a set of tricks that are commonly or not-so-commonly used to reduce coordination.

These are just some tricks that have popped to the top of my head.  There may be more and I’d love to see a vibrant discussion about other possible tricks to avoid coordination and/or other ways to taxonomize these tricks.”

“Nearly every time I need to drive a difficult, subtle, or contentious decision, I write a document. Sometimes that's half a page, sometimes its six pages. Sometimes much longer, although brevity is valuable. I see a few benefits to this approach that keep me coming back it it again and again.”

‘But beyond its cultural signals, market-minded aviation has another significant operational effect. Overall there’s less slack, because slack means economic waste. It’s extra equipment, extra spare parts, extra crew and staff that you could call on in an emergency, but that in normal times is just redundancy and “overhead.”’

“When people build a cloud infrastructure, they don’t want bugs that will lose people’s data. For the kind of application where precision is important, you need to be very rigorous. And you need something like TLA+, especially if there’s concurrency involved, which there usually is in these systems.”

“You may not necessarily like how authority influences relationships, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s true. If you are in a manager role, there will always be a power imbalance between you and other team members, so recognize it.”

“The malicious 'torchtriton' dependency on PyPI shares name with the official library published on the PyTorch-nightly's repo. But, when fetching dependencies in the Python ecosystem, PyPI normally takes precedence, causing the malicious package to get pulled on your machine instead of PyTorch's legitimate one.”

"I’m generally skeptical of these broad claims. More than anything, I think when people imagine integrating AI (and especially LLMs) into software development (or any other process), they tend to be overly optimistic."
