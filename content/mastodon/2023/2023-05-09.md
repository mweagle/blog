Eleven axes of "understandability":

* Static vs. dynamic

* Discrete vs. continuous

* Separable vs. interactive

* Sequential vs. simultaneous

* Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous

* Single vs. multiple representations

* Mechanism vs. organicism

* Linear vs. nonlinear

* Universal vs. conditional

* Regular vs. irregular

* Surface vs. deep

Content towards the right...encourages reductivist explanations and defensive responses to new "complexifying" information.

"What is available will be used. Every system is stretched to operate at its capacity. Systems keep some slack capacity, but if they operate for long periods of time without this capacity being called upon, it likely gets optimized away."

“Sadly, though its history in systems engineering is today unknown by most, the loaded term of “soft skills” remains, implying to many such skills are not as critical, important, or necessary, that they’re “not masculine,” or “not scientific,” or “not pertinent to the bottom line.”

All false and costly.

Maybe it’s time we just stopped using the term.”

“When I go up the mountain to ask the ChatGPT oracle a question, I am met with a blank face. What does this oracle know? How should I ask my question? And when it responds, it is endlessly confident. I can't tell whether or not it actually understand my question or where this information came from.

Good tools make it clear how they should be used.”

‘The whole tech team is now waiting for Davina’s afternoon talk. She begins in these words:

“It’s only by defining correctly the problems that we can find the best solutions. Dave says that our codebase is easy to understand; I disagree. So before diving into the cognitive load theory by itself, let’s ask ourselves: why is it so difficult to build applications which work, which are reliable, maintainable, and understandable?”’
