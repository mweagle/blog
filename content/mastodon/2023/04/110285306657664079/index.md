<p>Been out for a bit and I don’t know exactly what’s going on with exodus, social platform wars, and the like. </p><p>I do know that if people who don’t look like you or live like you are saying they have concerns, it costs absolutely nothing to be quiet and read more about their experiences. Then acknowledge and figure out how to help. Research before you reply. </p><p>Asking those targeted people to provide additional evidence to “help you understand” compounds the very problems they’re often citing.</p>
