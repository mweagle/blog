<p>What was the training set? </p><p>&quot;To collect data for our dataset, we looked for issues that were estimated with story points. JIRA is one of the few widely-used issue tracking systems that support agile development (and thus story point estimation) with its JIRA Agile plugin. Hence, we selected a diverse collection of nine major open source repositories that use the JIRA issue tracking system: Apache, Appcelerator, DuraSpace, Atlassian, Moodle, Lsstcorp, MuleSoft, Spring, and Talendforge.&quot;</p>
