<p>“The notion that it is easy to get ‘substantial gains’ through<br />computerisation is common in many fields. The implication<br />is that computerisation by itself reduces human error and<br />system breakdown. Any difficulties that are raised about the<br />computerisation process become mere details to be worked<br />out later.”</p><p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226450254_Nine_Steps_to_Move_Forward_from_Error" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">researchgate.net/publication/2</span><span class="invisible">26450254_Nine_Steps_to_Move_Forward_from_Error</span></a></p>

<p>“Those pesky details turn out to be critical in whether the computerisation creates new forms of failure. New technology can help and can hurt, often at the same time depending on how the technology is used to support technical work in context…Improper computerisation can simply exacerbate or create new forms of complexity to plague operations….<br />People and computers are not separate and independent,but are interwoven into a distributed system that performs cognitive work in context.”</p>
