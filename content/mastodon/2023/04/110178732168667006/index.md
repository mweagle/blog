<p>“Based on analysis of over half a million changes from Eclipse and Qt…they authors find that changes to build specs are less than half as likely to be discussed during code review as changes to application code, but that comments on those changes are more likely to point out defects than comments on code. They also find that developers&#39; lack of understanding and interest in build systems is a major hindrance to better review.”</p><p><a href="https://neverworkintheory.org/2023/04/10/code-review-of-build-specs.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">neverworkintheory.org/2023/04/</span><span class="invisible">10/code-review-of-build-specs.html</span></a></p>
