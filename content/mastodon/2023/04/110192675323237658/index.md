<p>If there is a rock in the highway, am I safer looking at the sign telling me there may be fallen rocks or avoiding the rock? If I take my eyes off the road to recognize the fallen rocks sign and miss seeing the rock in the road, was the sign helpful? </p><p>When there is an accident, hindsight chastising people for &quot;not seeing the signs&quot; doesn&#39;t create for safer passage. Consider investing in instruments to reduce the frequency of rocks on the road.</p>
