<p>“We must get out of the business of prediction and into the business of probing for what works and what doesn’t. The faster we learn, the better we get, and the more successful we are.<br />Probing in a complex environment happens best through safe-to-fail experiments…The emphasis is not on ensuring success or avoiding failure, but in allowing ideas that are not useful to fail in small, contained, and tolerable ways.”<br /><a href="https://hagakure.substack.com/p/twh52-dont-yell-at-the-weather" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">hagakure.substack.com/p/twh52-</span><span class="invisible">dont-yell-at-the-weather</span></a></p>
