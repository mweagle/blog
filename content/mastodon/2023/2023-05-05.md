Finally read the ğŸ¦œ paperâ€¦

â€œIn this paper, we have invited readers to take a step back and ask: Are ever larger LMs inevitable or necessary? What costs are associated with this research direction and what should we consider

before pursuing it? Do the field of NLP or the public that it serves in fact need larger LMs? If so, how can we pursue this research direction while mitigating its associated risks? If not, what do we need instead?â€

I don't know who needs to hear this, but there is no "magical perfect architecture/system" that is universally applicable for all organizations and workloads for all time which concurrently optimizes for cost, DX, security, velocity, reliability, extensibility, and optionality.

There are local decisions, constrained by path dependencies and decisions made under uncertainty with deadlines.

The only system that can avoid adaptation is the one that doesn't exist.

Going to use "Panda's Thumb" as the next project codename:

"Orchids were not made by an ideal engineer; they are jury-rigged from a limited set of available components. Thus, they must have evolved from ordinary flowers."

This is a much more eloquent take on the importance of designing evolvable architectures.

â€œHowever, I want to reiterate, that there is not one architectural pattern to rule them all. How you choose to develop, deploy, and manage services will always be driven by the product youâ€™re designing, the skillset of the team building it, and the experience you want to deliver to customers (and of course things like cost, speed, and resiliency).â€

Pre-emptive  offered

"This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate Ansible-YAML code, with the objective of building an AI assistant for Ansible-YAML users and improving their productivity. We propose the use of transformer-based models for the task of Ansible-YAML code generation given a natural language prompt."

â€œI want to talk about whatâ€™s appealing to me about build systems, why I (usually) still donâ€™t use them, and why I find it frustrating that some frontend Javascript libraries require that you use a build system.â€

â€œOften the justification for rewrites like this is â€œdeveloper productivity.â€ As a believer in developer productivity, I think this is a fine motivation, but there need to be measures behind that intuition that you can point to. â€œWe need to make it possible to ship the code base to production on demandâ€ is a much more compelling and clear project than â€œwe need to rewrite this system to increase developer productivity.â€â€
