â€œI love this story because a CSS change feels innocuous. CSS just controls presentation, right? How could that impact availability?â€

I think itâ€™s reasonable to assume that every change (whether internal or external) could impact availability. I also agree that not all changes will receive equal preflight scrutiny because of ETTO.

However, itâ€™s reasonable for all changes to (imperfectly) address how to gradually produce signal and how to undo if possible. This will also be incomplete, but shifts the default assumptions.
