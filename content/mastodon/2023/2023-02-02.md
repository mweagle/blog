Communication mantra I learned a little while back:

"Make it easy for me to help you"

“And four or five days before Tyre Nichols, there was a guy who claimed he had been beaten up in roughly the same way and that he tried to get the attention of the authorities and that they didn’t take him seriously…I and and certainly looking at what we saw, the video that we did, it’s reasonable to assume that that was not their first time attacking a citizen in quite that way before it looked like they had some experience with that before.”

“The earliest reference we found that speciﬁcally focused on describing and recommending iterative development was a 1968 report from Brian Randell and F.W. Zurcher at the IBM T.J.

“In his well-known 1970 article, “Managing the Development of Large Software Systems,” Winston Royce shared his opinions on what would become known as the waterfall model..Many—incorrectly—view Royce’s paper as the paragon of single-pass waterfall. In reality, he recommended an approach somewhat different than what has devolved into today’s waterfall concept, with its strict sequence of requirements analysis, design, and development phases. Indeed, Royce’s recommendation was to do it twice”

‘For example, for the daily space shuttle Mission Management Team meetings after Columbia, the agency moved to a larger room to accommodate more people and replaced a rectangular table with a circular table. The goal was to take what had been an intimidating setting and make it less so for participants to encourage people with dissenting opinions to speak up. With a round table, for example, there was no "head of the table."’
