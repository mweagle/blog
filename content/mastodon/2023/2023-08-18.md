"So, could it be that where everybody is seeking technological innovation, it’s management innovation that is also sorely needed? Could it be that if we stop relying on old outdated systems, explicitly designed for conformity and control, that people will actually more often do what leads to previously unimaginable businesses—without losing their minds in the process?”

What’s happening when nothing is happening is also happening before something happened.

“The argument is that there are no special ‘error producing’ processes that magically begin to work when an accident is going to happen, but which otherwise lie dormant. On the contrary, there are no fundamental differences between performance that leads to failures and performance that leads to successes.”
