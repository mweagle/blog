“With Go, I just don’t worry about that. Yes, there can be bugs, but nothing is going to break on purpose just because it made life easier for someone else. It feels like the language team is working for me instead of against me.”

“As a rule of thumb, though, good managers don’t attempt to cause growth by force. They take individual experience as both motivation and input, then shape healthy experiences by exerting force on the environment. Let me repeat: good managers usually frame their work as being most on structures, not directly on people.”

“Performance reviews, by refusing to acknowledge the role of context, allow bad systems to persist, tacitly conveying that the wider system is inevitable and must be accepted. Reviews often correctly diagnose challenges, but put responsibility inappropriately back on an individual, blaming them for their own marginalization or ineffectiveness. They take a person’s failure to be heard and give advice that they could have communicated better.”

Allowing me to provide mandatory filter criteria, then returning results that don't satisfy the criteria but include a text block with a "Missing: NNN" line isn't my preferred UX pattern.
