<p>Notable observations:</p><p>&quot;Proper  adoption of microservices requires several technical and  organizational changes companies need to consider.&quot;</p><p>&quot;&quot;In fact, communication and coordination within and between teams still remain a challenge.  Even though most companies  adopted microservice-based  architectures because of the  promise to decouple the teams,  synchronization and collaborative planning still takes  a substantial portion of the  teams‚Äô  time&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;More generally, several study participants noted that microservices is not a magic ‚Äúpixie dust‚Äù and transitioning to microservices cannot solve all development problems. Moreover, microservices are not the solution to all applications. Organizations should avoid being ‚Äúdeceived‚Äù by a few promises of microservices; more structured guidelines on  what  types  of  applications  would benefit from transitioning  to microservices and which should be more cautious about migrating would be helpful&quot;</p>
