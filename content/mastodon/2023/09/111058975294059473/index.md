<p>I would love to see a shift away from the “How can we get developers to care about {Security, Reliability, TCO, Efficiency, Complexity, Financials, Other}” style conversations. It’s reductionist and assumes that emotional investment at the sharp end is enough to produce a change in organizational decision making.  If some outcomes didn’t improve, I don’t think the guidance would be “a developer needs to care harder”.</p>

<p>There are too many non-functional system properties to be concurrently optimized in any system receiving customer traffic/usage. Individual caring is sufficient, but not necessary to produce different organizational outcomes. Invest in systems that make normal work incrementally and intermittently improve those outcomes.</p>

___

<p>Asking individuals to care more is an emotional plea to a group of people who are likely already caring about a lot. If leadership cares about different outcomes, prioritize them, agree on success/checkpoint criteria, and give the team space to experiment and deliver the improvement.</p>
