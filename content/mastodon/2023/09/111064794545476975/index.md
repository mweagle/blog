<p>“A naive assumption is often made that reusing software or using commercial off-the-shelf software will increase safety since the software will have been exercised extensively. Reusing software modules does not guarantee safety in the new system to which it is transferred and <br />sometimes leads to awkward and dangerous designs. Safety is a quality of the system in <br />which the software is used; it is not a quality of the software itself.”</p><p><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs240/old/sp2014/readings/therac-25.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">web.stanford.edu/class/cs240/o</span><span class="invisible">ld/sp2014/readings/therac-25.pdf</span></a></p>

<p>Evergreen checklist from Leveson &amp; Turner (1993) from their review of the tragic Therac-25 fatal patient dosages:<br /> <br />“Some basic software engineering principles that apparently were violated <br />in the case of the Therac-25 include: <br />• Documentation should not be an afterthought. <br />• Software quality assurance practices and standards should be established. <br />• Designs should be kept simple. <br />…”</p>

<p>“• Ways to get information about errors, i.e, software audit trails, should be designed <br />into the software from the beginning. <br />• The software should be subjected to extensive testing and formal analysis at the <br />module and software level; system testing alone is not adequate. “</p><p>This is a great paper that highlights core safety principles stemming from a truly horrible series of events.</p>
