“Tools and resources that are designed to help you during an incident or just during a normal day can cause their own problems. On the other hand, those things that are unexpected can sometimes help you as well.”

“One big problem with all of this is that it makes building and operating Serverless applications ever more complicated. The larger the surface area of techniques that an engineer can use, the more decisions they need to make.“
