If GenAI is as powerful, reliable, and transformative as trumpeted in this Pollyannish survey (ğŸ¤¨), then there would be no need to produce those communication artifacts that create shared context between people.

Tests - why LLM test cases? Just tell GenAI: â€œFix this bug and enforce correctnessâ€.  Correctness is the objective, not writing tests.

I have so many questions.

â€œSoftware engineering managers (or any senior technical leaders) have many responsibilities: the care and feeding of the team, delivering on business outcomes, and keeping the product/system/application up and running and in good order. Each of these areas can benefit from a systematic approach.â€

â€œDecisions are about saying â€œnoâ€ even more than saying â€œyes.â€ Without articulating the â€œnoâ€™s,â€ the team is less focused, the decisions are less clear, and stakeholders wonder whether youâ€™re even aware of the problems that you chose not to tackle.â€

â€œIf you want to understand why your systems perform the way they do, itâ€™s necessary to know how expertise is created and distributed amongst the people in your organization. The single best way to do this is to invest in incident analysis.â€

â€œUnfortunately, thereâ€™s a problem with this model: complex systems donâ€™t fail the way that chains do. In a complex system, there are an enormous number of couplings between the different components.â€

â€œAfter several research projects and across 25+ in-depth sessions with teams tasked with engineering transformation, as a psychologist for software teams, I think we're fundamentally failing to prepare engineering managers to handle the sociocognitive work of triage.â€

â€œIn 2023, discovery, exploration, and invention are just vibes you rent, by investing in a future-costumed effort to ignore all of what's already been learned and pretend "making a car that works" (or tunnels, or spaceships, or social media) is a new frontier.â€
