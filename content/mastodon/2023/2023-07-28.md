“Cognitive load theory defines three types of load that are imposed when we undertake a learning or problem-solving experience: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane. Each contributes to the total cognitive load imposed on our working memory. In this article I’ll explain some simple ways that we can manage each type of load using techniques that most development teams may already be familiar with.”

“Similar to the assertion that developers are human, the assertion that software engineering work is nonlinear and unpredictable is often met with agreement. But again, we see attempts to simplify engineering work to make the problem of engineering productivity more tractable. “
