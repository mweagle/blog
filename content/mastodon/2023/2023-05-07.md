“This is the autopilot problem: How do you know when the computer is giving you a wrong answer? Ideally, you know because you have enough experience to know what the right answer looks like, but this assumes you are paying attention to the answer you’ve been given.”

“The Prime Video team had followed a path I call Serverless First, where the first try at building something is put together with Step Functions and Lambda calls. They state in the blog that this was quick to build, which is the point…In contrast to commentary along the lines that Amazon got it wrong, the team followed what I consider to be the best practice.”

“Meanwhile it is still popular to build either/or architectures where the machine does all the work and people are supposed to monitor the machine to jump in when it is doing the wrong thing. Or…the machine does all the work till it can no longer, and then it dumps the messy situation into some human’s hands—bumpy transfers of control. With every either/or architecture comes new opportunities to observe the same unintended and undesirable effects as I observed in the mid-1980’s”
