[@thudfactor](https://hachyderm.io/@thudfactor) Exactlyâ€¦Later Greenstein is quoted as saying: â€œThe idea of paying on the outcome â€” you know, â€˜I saved your money, Iâ€™ll get some, you get some, everybody winsâ€™ â€” itâ€™s a really interesting model in AI, because there are a lot of things [where] you can assure an outcome,â€ he says. â€œAnd I think those will be very compelling commercialization models.â€

If ever there were an opportunity for Assertive Ignorance it's this type of analysisâ€¦

LLMs can be allstar players in a confidence game.

[@thudfactor](https://hachyderm.io/@thudfactor) "The first place close observers like Greenstein believe adoption may occur widely is IT â€” especially around software development, customer service, and back-office tasks, such as processing inbound forms.â€

Interesting that "replacing analysts" isn't one of the first areas that will see adoption.
