<p>Been nagging at me that the Eric Yuan interview is about scaling individual presence rather than organizational capacity. </p><p>So much about high-performing organizations is about diversity, psych safety, and collaboration producing better outcomes. How people from different backgrounds, perspectives, and skills effectively work together. This requires care, training and apprenticeship.</p><p>The &quot;digital twin&quot; view is about duplicating a single individual&#39;s virtual presence.</p>
