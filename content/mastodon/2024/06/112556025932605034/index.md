<p>I can only imagine the environment that makes this seem desirable, inevitable, or even possible:</p><p>“Today for this session, ideally, I do not need to join. I can send a digital version of myself to join so I can go to the beach. Or I do not need to check my emails; the digital version of myself can read most of the emails.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24168733/zoom-ceo-ai-clones-digital-twins-videoconferencing-decoder-interview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">theverge.com/2024/6/3/24168733</span><span class="invisible">/zoom-ceo-ai-clones-digital-twins-videoconferencing-decoder-interview</span></a></p>

<p>“But if you look at just videoconferencing itself, I think we can leverage AI more and more. You do not need to spend so much time [in meetings]. You do not have to have five or six Zoom calls every day. You can leverage the AI to do that. “</p><p>You could…also choose to schedule fewer meetings.</p>

<p>“Why not spend more time with your family? Why not focus on some more creative things, giving you back your time, giving back to the community and society to help others, right? Today, the reason why we cannot do that is because every day is busy, five days a week.”</p><p>We are ~6 years away from the centennial anniversary of Keynes’ 15 hour workweek prediction. </p><p>I don’t have a chart, but I don’t think we’re trending to hit that.</p>

<p>Looking forward to Jepsen LLM tests that are referenced in unlawful termination suits. </p><p>“Q: Let me ask you this: what do you think is the limit? If I have a digital twin of me that can go to Zoom meetings or appear at conferences, should I be able to send a hundred digital twins out in the world? A thousand? Is there a limit? Do you think there should be a limit?</p><p>A: I don’t think there’s a limit. It really depends on yourself. “</p>
