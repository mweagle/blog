And we change the system by making everyone involved, especially those in authority, feel urgency about changing the real-world impacts that a system has.”</p><p><a href="https://www.anildash.com//2024/05/29/systems-the-purpose-of-a-system/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">anildash.com//2024/05/29/syste</span><span class="invisible">ms-the-purpose-of-a-system/</span></a></p>
