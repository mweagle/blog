<p>“People want credit for the cleverness of their idea. And the line of thinking goes, more complex means more clever, which means they are smarter. Customers don&#39;t care about that. They just want to understand how your product fits into their life and when they should use it. That&#39;s it.”</p><p><a href="https://andrewchen.substack.com/p/why-your-product-idea-sounds-too?publication_id=2401262" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">andrewchen.substack.com/p/why-</span><span class="invisible">your-product-idea-sounds-too?publication_id=2401262</span></a></p>
