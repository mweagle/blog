<p>Trying to feed the right wolf…🐺</p><p>I&#39;ve been learning guitar with Jason for a couple of years. He&#39;s a very talented musician and a supportive instructor. Over the past couple of months he&#39;s started sharing more of his own playing on YouTube. Get in touch with him if you&#39;ve ever thought about learning to play. 🤘</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlmDhfrwxFE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">youtube.com/watch?v=KlmDhfrwxF</span><span class="invisible">E</span></a></p>
