“One of the dumbest things managers do is say things like “you should spend less time playing ping pong and more time working.” Trying to standardize how knowledge workers spend their day is bound for to create docile, poor performers, or attrition. Focus on work that gets done, not the things between work.”

"The core of the problem? Microsoft Authenticator will overwrite an account with the same username. Given the prominent use of email addresses for usernames, most users’ apps share the same username. Google Authenticator and just about every other authenticator app add the name of the issuer — such as a bank or a car company — to avoid this issue. Microsoft only uses the username.”

You might need to manage what you can't measure, but you can't manage what you don't acknowledge.

"I would love to have a successful test of a 9HA.02. That’s really big," said Lammas, a GE veteran who migrated from GE aircraft engines to turbines.

"We have a lot of — how can I put it — managers that have finance backgrounds, so they don’t understand that engineers sometimes have problems."

"The most surprising thing in my opinion is that you’re permitted to spend more than six months working on shaving off minutes from a CI pipeline that runs 50 builds a day.”

“The thing that made this possible is that we designed our system from the start with non-disruptive maintenance events in mind. We could retarget EBS volumes to new storage servers, and update software or rebuild the empty servers as needed.”
