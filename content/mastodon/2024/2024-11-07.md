Trying to feed the right wolf…🐺

I've been learning guitar with Jason for a couple of years. He's a very talented musician and a supportive instructor. Over the past couple of months he's started sharing more of his own playing on YouTube. Get in touch with him if you've ever thought about learning to play. 🤘
