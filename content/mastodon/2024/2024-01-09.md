"As you build your organization, beware the siren song of ‘DevRel.’ Instead, get specific, think about what you actually need to accomplish, what to call it, and which teams are best suited to address it.”

" If you don’t know exactly what the software does—or if it might do something different the next time you compile it—you can’t build a business around it. You certainly can’t maintain it, extend it, or add new features if it changes whenever you touch it, nor can you debug it."

Drift into Failure:

“A federal officer has now revealed that the same Boeing airplane involved in the incident on January 5 was barred from conducting flights overseas following the illumination of a warning light suggesting a potential pressurization issue on three separate occasions. These warning lights were reported on flights conducted on December 7, January 3, and 4 (a day before the incident).”

“Yet, performance pressures on the overall system (greater efficiency or throughput)

tend to push practitioners back to the edge of the performance envelope rather than

taking the benefits of the changes in increased safety margin or lower workload. As a

result, surprises occur in the form of accidents (fundamentally surprising new paths

to failure) and in the form of negative side effects of the change unanticipated by

designers—‘automation surprises’”
