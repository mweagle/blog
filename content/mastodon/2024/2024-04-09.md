“GGUF has the same type of layout as GGML, with metadata and tensor data in a single file, but in addition is also designed to be backwards-compatible. The key difference is that previously instead of a list of values for the hyperparameters, the new file format uses a key-value lookup tables which accomodate shifting values.”

“A key principle of modern accident investigation is that it’s the people within a complex system who bring the adaptability and creativity needed to keep it functioning. Since the resilience of the system relies on these people, we must approach the postmortem process from their perspective and empathize with their experience.”

“In hindsight, it's clear the project and the maintainer were struggling. He was working alone for years. He had a bug tracker and a mailing list that were both filled with aggressive and demanding outsiders. And he had no one to help. No backup, no plan for succession, nothing. The thing that alarms me about the situation is that no one found this alarming at the time.”
