“Even if we can't define integration test, we still have recognize them. There are tests that are bigger than our "unit tests" and smaller than an end-to-end test, and people have strong opinions about writing more or less of them.”

“It’s inevitable to have some number of load-bearing employees at any given point, but it’s a bad sign if the identities of load-bearing employees remain the same over time.

Dystopian sci fi is supposed to be a warning, not a goal.

“At the end of the hourlong flight, Kendall climbed out of the cockpit grinning. He said he’d seen enough during his flight that he’d trust this still-learning AI with the ability to decide whether or not to launch weapons in war.”
