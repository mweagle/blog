<p>‚ÄúWhat keeps the software alive are the programmers who have an accurate mental model (theory) of how it is built and works. That mental model can only be learned by having worked on the project while it grew or by working alongside somebody who did, who can help you absorb the theory. Replace enough of the programmers, and their mental models become disconnected from the reality of the code, and the code dies.‚Äù<br /><a href="https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2022/theory-building/?utm_source=pocket_shared" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">baldurbjarnason.com/2022/theor</span><span class="invisible">y-building/?utm_source=pocket_shared</span></a></p>
