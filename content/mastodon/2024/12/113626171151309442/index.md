<p>“But even for humans, sensor problems are difficult. While we’ll eventually figure out what’s going on, we’ll still struggle in the face of conflicting signals, as anyone who has responded to an incident can tell you. And in high-tempo situations, where we need to respond quickly enough or something terrible will happen…we simply might not be able to respond quickly enough.”<br /><a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/12/07/your-lying-virtual-eyes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/12</span><span class="invisible">/07/your-lying-virtual-eyes/</span></a></p>
