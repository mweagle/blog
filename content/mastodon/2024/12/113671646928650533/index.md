<p>‚ÄúWhen all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. In hypergrowth mode, you solve every problem by throwing more resources at the system.

Hypergrowth encourages a raft of bad habits, and attacking every problem by hiring more people is one of them.‚Äù</p><p><a href="https://charity.wtf/2024/12/17/founder-mode-and-the-art-of-mythmaking/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">charity.wtf/2024/12/17/founder</span><span class="invisible">-mode-and-the-art-of-mythmaking/</span></a></p>
