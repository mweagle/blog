<p>“We had a problem. After years of &quot;Agile Transformation&quot; followed by rolling out the Scaled Agile Framework, we were not delivering any better. In fact, we delivered less frequently with bigger failures than when we had no defined processes. We had to find a way to deliver better value to the business. SAFe, with all of the ceremonies and process overhead that comes with it, wasn’t getting that done.”</p><p><a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/replace-process-dogma-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">infoq.com/articles/replace-pro</span><span class="invisible">cess-dogma-engineering/</span></a></p>

<p>What was the way?</p><p>“Relentlessly overcoming the problems that prevent frequent delivery also lowers process overhead and the cost of change. That, in turn, makes it economically more attractive to try new ideas and get feedback instead of just hoping your investment returns results. You don’t need SAFe’s PI planning when you have product roadmaps and teams that handle dependencies with code.”</p>
