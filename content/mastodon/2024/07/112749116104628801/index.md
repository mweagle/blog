<p>“What about things (i.e., tasks or activities) your team need to do to realize the objective and key results? Key results are outcomes your stakeholders want to see. Those are generally fixed. You might change or refine the activities when the going gets tough, but should generally keep the goals and key results the same.”</p><p><a href="https://www.subbu.org/articles/2024/goal-crafting/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">subbu.org/articles/2024/goal-c</span><span class="invisible">rafting/</span></a></p>
