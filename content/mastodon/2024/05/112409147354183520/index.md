<p>For me, Scala almost offers _too_ much flexibility and expressiveness. I still remember frustrations with implicits. </p><p>‚ÄúBut Scala also has its set of challenges when it comes to writing lean code. The language is both very flexible and very expressive. Its flexibility allows code bases to be written in many different styles. Its expressiveness can encourage over-abstraction. This means that trying to find your way in an unfamiliar Scala codebase is sometimes difficult.‚Äù</p><p><a href="https://odersky.github.io/blog/2024-04-11-post.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">odersky.github.io/blog/2024-04</span><span class="invisible">-11-post.html</span></a></p>
