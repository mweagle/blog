<p>“The superior mindset and approach is betterment. Start by deeply understanding the choices that have produced the most painful gaps between what we wish was happening and what is happening. Start with the first gap and make a new set of choices. But don’t forget the current choices that have produced the gap.”</p><p><a href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/where-to-start-with-strategy-bae40506304c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">rogermartin.medium.com/where-t</span><span class="invisible">o-start-with-strategy-bae40506304c</span></a></p>
