<p>“What I’m really doing is changing the engineering culture at OpenSesame. Culture doesn’t change easily. It tends to snap back. True change involves changing hundreds of little day-to-day decisions. That’s hard, even when people want to make those changes, and full buy-in is hard to come by.”</p><p><a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2024/a-software-engineering-career-ladder" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2024/a-</span><span class="invisible">software-engineering-career-ladder</span></a></p>
