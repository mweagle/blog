<p>“Any time you have a lag time and some amount of uncertainty, you will get oscillation as you constantly overshoot and then undershoot the balance point. If you’ve ever dealt with a shower that takes a particularly long time for the temperature to adjust, you’ll have an intuitive understanding of why this is. This means that the best practice is to make multiple small nudges over time instead of one big shift all at once.”</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@komorama/surfing-through-trade-offs-dc856d0d2bb9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">medium.com/@komorama/surfing-t</span><span class="invisible">hrough-trade-offs-dc856d0d2bb9</span></a></p>
