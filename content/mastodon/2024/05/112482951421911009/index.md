<p>“I&#39;ve used lots of bad websites in my life. Hell, I&#39;ve made a lot of bad websites in my life.

Everything was as poorly designed as possible, with user hostile design at every corner.”</p><p><a href="https://matduggan.com/the-worst-website-in-the-entire-world/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">matduggan.com/the-worst-websit</span><span class="invisible">e-in-the-entire-world/</span></a></p>
