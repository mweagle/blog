“Using the custom iterators actually added in Go 1.23 and writing return func(yield func(int) bool) is a little bit awkward, but it’s much better than needing to pass around close tokens and use them at every call site.”

“…I asked him if he knew there was no ahead 2/3 on the EPM.

“Yes, Captain, I did.”

“Well, why did you order it?” I asked, astounded.

“Because you told me to.””

“Go 1.23 comes with a new package unique implementing interning, and a blog post about it. Interning is re-using objects of equal value instead of keeping duplicate equal objects in memory. It is intended to reduce memory usage.”

“So I tried to adopt the worldview of a weary developer trying to unit-test their patterns and simultaneously fighting JSON and Go about what \\ might mean. And I thought “What if I used some other character for escaping in the regexp? One that didn’t have special meanings to multiple layers of software?””

“Because of this hate, there’s a good chance that these two factions are somehow at war in your company, and while all your leadership instincts are going to tell you to negotiate a peace treaty, you might want to encourage the war.”

“The point is that the architecture team didn't know what the value of their systems were, or how different components contributed to the broader business performance. We find this to be a common gap in thinking, when we do these assessments we usually ask to talk to the relevant people from the finance department. That's usually greeted by “why would you want to talk to them?””

Code, especially over time, is a side effect of understanding. Unfortunately, one of those has lower measurement costs than the other.

““Software development is 90% brain function — understanding the requirements, designing the system, and considering limitations and restrictions,” he adds. “Converting all this knowledge and understanding into actual code is a simpler part of the job.””

Constraints are good and I encourage engineers to declare them, but they are also typically in tension with each other.

“Even when constraints don’t affect each other, every new one has to build off the complexity of the code handling prior constraints.”

“Mmmmmmmm, others. The ones who have always stood a little bit outside the system. Who could never quite adjust themselves to the right configuration to fit into the workings. Who have always felt a bit out of place. Who look at the systems, all of them, and wonder, Is this really the best we can do? “

“We should also remember that our office spaces are often hostile to neurodivergent and disabled people in ways that are not immediately obvious. Companies and managers need to be sensitive to these problems.

If you do require everyone to be in the office, look around. Does your floorplan automatically exclude anyone in a wheelchair? Do you have amplification in large conference rooms?”

“Don’t let the formality of the roles get in the way of you sharing your perspectives and input. Just because your manager or product manager assigned you some work, it doesn’t mean you should just blindly execute. This is a behavior I see often with engineers, and it holds them back.”
