“The species of Aepyornis are amongst the largest birds, with weights of 235 kilograms (520 lb) estimated for A. hildebrandti and 275–1,000 kilograms (610–2,200 lb) for A. maximus, making it one of the largest, if not the largest bird to have ever lived, with the latter reaching 3 metres (9.8 ft) in height.”
