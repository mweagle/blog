That the first/best Tracy Chapman and Luke Combs Grammy performance search result is on X rather than the Grammys own YouTube channel explains a lot about traditional media.

Great conversation led by [@ryaneccles](https://mstdn.social/@ryaneccles) , [@adrianco](https://mastodon.social/@adrianco) and [@RuthMalan](https://mastodon.social/@RuthMalan) in today's <https://papersin.systems/>. We talked about <http://papersin.systems/sessions/2024-02-supply-chain-metrics.html> which provides in-tension evaluation criteria for defining metrics. Topics included sustainability, carbon markets, data standardization, JIRA, OKRs, tailwhip effects, and a consensus that collecting metrics is not a goal in itself.

Keep tabs on the next session at <https://papersin.systems/> and hope to see you there!

“Teams already know why progress is slow or why costs are high. Typically it’s much better to measure aspects of toil, cost, or the things that are preventing a team from achieving subjective productivity than it is to measure productivity of some blackbox metric of units of value delivered divided by cost.”

“In short, you probably have all the metrics you need to start automating your deployments today. You just need to look at them a little differently.”

"These are not reassuring numbers. When almost three-quarters of the interviews in which the interviewees were told explicitly (by the experimenters) to not rely on their own skills, but exclusively on ChatGPT are considered "confident", you really have to wonder: How good is your interview process? How many false positives are you allowing through? How many false negatives?"

I agree with this sentiment and the hard work is turning physical proximity into beneficial outcomes...for both the *people* and their *work together.*

Putting zero-sum, closed-minded, toxic, prejudiced and generally unpleasant people together will not magically produce better results. Although it's guaranteed to encourage people with different values to start looking for new organizations.

Westrum's organizational model observations (<https://itrevolution.com/articles/westrums-organizational-model-in-tech-orgs/>) embrace location transparency. It's just as easy to shoot the messenger over Slack as it is over a conference table.

RTO mandates only affect the exposure profile, not the risk of exposure.

Physical proximity does provide more secondary signals for juniors about what's normal and acceptable. It also *can* reduce the communication costs and social anxiety around asking learning questions.

But it can just as easily signal that their questions are "Googleable" and "something they should know". Plus, evolution has equipped us with diverse facial recognition and body language reading skills.

TL;DR: It was/still is a pandemic, not a normal "distributed team" environment. Values and behaviors can be expressed in many different ways. An office is a place, not a gateway to an alternative universe.
