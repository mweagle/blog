# Toots from 2024-03-08

## Thinking about writing a small script.

Thinking about writing a small script.

With the benefit of hindsight, there is still no clear path.

Based on <https://rossabaker.com/projects/toot-archive/>, I'm writing a script that transforms my exported fediarchive to Hugo static pages. I'd like to avoid any package dependencies and while`go` generics make dealing with the AP JSON a bit easier, it's still awkward.

The “script”…is not so very small anymore. I have something workable that produces Hugo pages (<https://mweagle.net/mastodon/2022/11/109391558340367549/>) and preserves media refs.

Being able to search through old Toots is both disturbing to write and a nice feature.
