Remembering the time I went to the office and I was one of two people wearing masks. A person from another team, sitting across the monitor from me (open floorplan, edge to edge desks lengthwise), was taking video calls most of the day from their desk. My monitor faced the primary hallway which was ~6 feet behind my back so I couldn’t work on docs that might be sensitive.

I later reserved an entire conference room just for me to work.  Like an extra large office.

“Private investment funds are directly responsible for major problems at the newspaper chains I studied for the book. That includes GateHouse, Gannett, Journal Register, Knight Ridder, McClatchy, MediaNews Group and Tribune. These funds played different roles in these chains, but the roles they played when taken together over a 20-year period proved disastrous.”

“And if it happens for those “hard” technologies, it’s definitely going to happen for ones where copy/paste exists and open sourcing is a thing.”
