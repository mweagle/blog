Been nagging at me that the Eric Yuan interview is about scaling individual presence rather than organizational capacity.

So much about high-performing organizations is about diversity, psych safety, and collaboration producing better outcomes. How people from different backgrounds, perspectives, and skills effectively work together. This requires care, training and apprenticeship.

The "digital twin" view is about duplicating a single individual's virtual presence.

Rather than pushing authority to knowledge, lossily replicating authority to consume more information.

It's a desire to train software to poorly mimic a person, rather than training people to work as a team.

I realize the economic incentives behind this sentiment. But for an industry renowned for, let's say, less than stellar training, inclusivity, and fostering growth, the emphasis on “training, but for machines to make more me” is something.

“Regardless of format, managers can make use of digital and physical tools, clear agendas, and facilitating open communication to enhance collaboration across all meeting spaces.”

“The goal here is create a space where feedback is given, so that when there is mission critical information about your performance as their manager, there is a comfortable and safe way to surface that information.”

I can only imagine the environment that makes this seem desirable, inevitable, or even possible:

“Today for this session, ideally, I do not need to join. I can send a digital version of myself to join so I can go to the beach. Or I do not need to check my emails; the digital version of myself can read most of the emails.”

“But if you look at just videoconferencing itself, I think we can leverage AI more and more. You do not need to spend so much time [in meetings]. You do not have to have five or six Zoom calls every day. You can leverage the AI to do that. “

You could…also choose to schedule fewer meetings.

“Why not spend more time with your family? Why not focus on some more creative things, giving you back your time, giving back to the community and society to help others, right? Today, the reason why we cannot do that is because every day is busy, five days a week.”

We are ~6 years away from the centennial anniversary of Keynes’ 15 hour workweek prediction.

I don’t have a chart, but I don’t think we’re trending to hit that.

Looking forward to Jepsen LLM tests that are referenced in unlawful termination suits.

“Q: Let me ask you this: what do you think is the limit? If I have a digital twin of me that can go to Zoom meetings or appear at conferences, should I be able to send a hundred digital twins out in the world? A thousand? Is there a limit? Do you think there should be a limit?

A: I don’t think there’s a limit. It really depends on yourself. “

“My co-worker then had a brilliant idea: Make two trips.

If the current architecture makes the project impossible, she concluded that first we must create a project that changes the architecture. Then the migration project would be possible.”

“They need to, at an engineering and secure by design level, go back and review how authentication works — as it’s pretty transparent that given the number of victims and scale of the breach that the status quo hasn’t worked.”
