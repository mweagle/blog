“But instead of frightening us with 100 floors of duds, it really does seem like AWS is making some attempt to double down on making their good stuff better.”

Yes.

“The a-ha moment is this: everything you’re doing should be solving a problem. Align your team on the biggest problems you have. Derive your technical roadmap based on solving those problems. Periodically revisit your problems list to make sure it is still accurate.”

“As part of a push to improve reliability across the organization, we’ve been working to improve our cluster-wide observability tooling to strengthen visibility into the state of our systems. At 3:12 PM PST, we deployed a new telemetry service to collect detailed Kubernetes control plane metrics. “

“Looking at the themes from the top unprompted complaints from each CISO, three issues emerged consistently across conversations: access management, vulnerability management, and SaaS logs.”

Glad to see this merger rejected…

“The commission’s logic was simple. Kroger and Albertsons, if they combine, will gain market power and use it to raise prices to consumers and lower wages to workers.”

“But I thought it was appropriate, as someone who straddles the two domains of AI and production engineering/SRE/DevOps/whatever we’re calling it today, to go into why I think this technology, as important, as useful, and as cosmically powerful as it is, today has fundamental limits to success, that…LLMs are dangerous to use, and that - as the title implies - that LLMs won’t save us.”

How many organizations lurched from Code Yellow to Code Yellow but have not lived to tell their story?

“At Instacart, despite our best efforts to not have this be the case, we leaned on Code Yellow’s so aggressively that they became part of our standard operating cadence.”

“When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. In hypergrowth mode, you solve every problem by throwing more resources at the system. The tools you learn are weird ones, which map awkwardly to the skills you need to run a normal, sustainable company that’s expected to turn a profit. Hypergrowth encourages a raft of bad habits, and attacking every problem by hiring more people is one of them.”

“Dr. Deming famously said that 94% of a company’s troubles, and possibilities for improvement, belong to the system, while only 6% are attributable to the people in it. And the system is the responsibility of management.”
