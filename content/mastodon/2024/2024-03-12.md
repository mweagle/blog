"So maybe a decision didn’t go your way. Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of a roomful of straw and you need to give this to your team to build meaningful things from. They are not going to like being given straw. So I recommend spinning it into gold first before presenting it to the team.”

"A name also has the power to take a laundry list of items/bugs/tickets and turn them into something that you can communicate about…This grouping of items can also make it easier to measure impact: A few individual work items might not drastically change the product quality or NPS (net promoter score), but a grouping of enough of them could have a measurable impact on these types of metrics.”

Adding to this insight - naming something and associating it with a larger (potentially measurable) outcome can create space for the team to propose new ideas. It can help move conversation from output based (close the known tickets) to outcome based (increase NPS score, closing the tickets as a byproduct).  It may cause new work items to be created - some of which may completely obsolete the known ones.

This is very similar to processes I've bootstrapped. I do prefer ongoing tech debt paydown as part of deliverables rather than Fixit Sprints. Either way, invest in long-term productivity.

Strongest agree:

"Separately, it’s worth highlighting again that a big part of this process is making sure that the people who are doing the work understand why they’re doing it so that they can make small judgment calls on their own and know when to come back and ask for guidance.”

"From a software development perspective, the organization might look agile and fast, given the team releases software every two weeks. But from the end customer’s point of view, it could take a year to implement an urgent request.”

"There's also a meta-problem here which you need to learn to handle if you want to enter leadership roles.

Explain the impact, not the problem”
