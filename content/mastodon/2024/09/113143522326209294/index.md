<p>‘Operation failed. Please try again later’ is not a user-empathetic error message. </p><p>“As a result, defensive programming is vastly more necessary for shipped applications. Many things can and will go wrong that the developer never anticipated, and the application needs to be able to fail gracefully. That includes non-fatal error messages that provide some indication to the user of what&#39;s wrong and how they can fix it and what to tell the development team.”</p><p><a href="https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/best-practices" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">garfieldtech.com/blog/best-pra</span><span class="invisible">ctices</span></a></p>
