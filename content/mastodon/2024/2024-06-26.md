“Throughout my journey in DevOps, I've encountered numerous individuals quietly battling this affliction.

“The Kano model shows that even if more features add to your products, it doesn’t mean that customer satisfaction will also increase accordingly. No matter how good the features are, some do not create positive customer satisfaction.”
