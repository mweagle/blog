<p>“Most people are heavily biased by their own experience, are inclined to credit skill rather than luck, brilliance rather than being in a position to be in the right place at the right time. It’s easy to tell a story about how you did the right things when the numbers were going up, and it’s hard to know what worked and what didn’t when the numbers are going down.”</p><p><a href="https://cate.blog/2024/10/22/how-can-you-be-a-good-leader-in-a-bad-market/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">cate.blog/2024/10/22/how-can-y</span><span class="invisible">ou-be-a-good-leader-in-a-bad-market/</span></a></p>
