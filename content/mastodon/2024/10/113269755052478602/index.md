<p>‚ÄúWe focus on understanding the problem as a team, documenting the work required and eliminating our uncertainties by breaking the work down into queues of tasks. We adjust the tasks as we receive new information or scope changes, track average task rates for the teams for projection and capacity planning without having to provide estimates at all. All of our time spent planning produces output that is both useful and reliable.‚Äù</p><p><a href="https://www.brightball.com/articles/story-points-are-pointless-measure-queues" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">brightball.com/articles/story-</span><span class="invisible">points-are-pointless-measure-queues</span></a></p>
