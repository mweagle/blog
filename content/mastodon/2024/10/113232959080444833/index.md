<p>@petersforbes@sigmoid.social Yep. I can imagine juniors using it because documentation is lacking and LLMs are non-judgmental. Going from zero to anything is a major win.</p><p>I can also envision senior ICs realizing that the questions they&#39;re asking are much more complex &amp; context-rich. The proposed changes may also induce systemic failures-at-a-distance that aren&#39;t LLM friendly.</p>
