<p>“The &quot;knowing-doing gap&quot; refers to the disconnect between what people know—such as leadership theories or best practices—and what they actually implement in their day-to-day work. This gap is particularly relevant in leadership roles, where understanding leadership principles doesn’t always translate into effective action.”</p><p><a href="https://rdel.substack.com/p/rdel-62-why-does-the-knowing-doing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">rdel.substack.com/p/rdel-62-wh</span><span class="invisible">y-does-the-knowing-doing</span></a></p>
