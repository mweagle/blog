<p>“Don’t let the formality of the roles get in the way of you sharing your perspectives and input. Just because your manager or product manager assigned you some work, it doesn’t mean you should just blindly execute. This is a behavior I see often with engineers, and it holds them back.”</p><p><a href="https://www.thecaringtechie.com/p/lessons-from-projects-that-didnt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">thecaringtechie.com/p/lessons-</span><span class="invisible">from-projects-that-didnt</span></a></p>
