Years ago I used to "play" table tennis with a co-worker who was years removed from being a semi-pro player in Taiwan.

It was a rare day when I could score a point.

"He placed some blame on the valuations of big tech companies, which lately have been lifted by generative AI hype, saying, “...they’re building the future, and they have to make sure they fortify the current”

“The key to making dependencies work is wiggle room, slack. If I accept a dependency on your team, I want to see slack in your schedule. I don’t care about your earliest possible ship date if absolutely everything goes perfectly. Irrelevant.”

"Basically, there is a process, there are validation and verification checks, and there’s someone looking at what happens. Yet, things still break from time to time. If we were to look for a quick solution, it would be easy to think that some things were lacking, that someone missed something."

Q: “Is AI driving efficiency or fueling burnout?” (<https://www.upwork.com/research/ai-enhanced-work-models>)

A: “The Rise of the Triple Peak Day” (<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/triple-peak-day>)

An increase in output that's correlated with increasing an input (time) is not a productivity increase. It is an increase in aggregate output.

The Upwork writeup reads like it's trying to maximize cognitive dissonance:

- "While 69% of C-suite leaders admit they’re aware that employees are struggling to keep up with productivity demands, 84% are adamant their companies value employee well-being over productivity.”

##### [Mastodon Source 🐘](https://hachyderm.io/@mweagle/112885166232481421)

- "Employees are just as excited about the potential of AI as their leaders, with 65% believing these technologies can increase productivity…Nearly half (47%) of workers using AI say they have no idea how to achieve the productivity gains their employers expect.”

##### [Mastodon Source 🐘](https://hachyderm.io/@mweagle/112885166831822194)

- "One in two executives at companies using AI believe their company is falling behind their competitors (51%) and that their workforce’s overall productivity levels are stalled due to lack of employee skills and adoption (50%)... Thirty-seven percent of C-suite leaders at companies that use AI said their workforce is “highly” skilled and comfortable with these tools, but only 17% of employees actually reported this level of skill and comfort. “

This pivot was predictable:

”We risk another productivity paradox with generative AI if we don’t fundamentally rethink the way we work.”

Well, that sounds interesting at least. Maybe a Cal Newport vibe is incoming…I wonder what they think that might look like:

"1. Leverage nontraditional talent

When compared with full-time employees, more freelancers claim to be AI-ready.”

" So what do we do? The answer is NOT "nothing".

Seniors, Experts, Staff, Principals, however we might call them still need leadership, just a different kind. What to do? "

I can understand the allure of this, but I  think “specifying requirements" isn't really easier.

"There is little doubt that new jobs will be required in the AI age. Computer scientists’ work will morph into designing programs that specify requirements that will be compiled directly into the code, rather than them writing the code itself, Simmons says.”
