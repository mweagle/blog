"Your role isn’t about micromanagement. It’s about supporting the manager in driving results, watching for blind spots or gaps in project plans or team development. A proactive approach involves asking questions, fostering learning opportunities, and focusing on coaching rather than direct problem-solving."

This is a good read

"The Manifesto and its Principles heralded a brighter future that still seems distant all these decades later. Indeed, about sixty percent of Agile teams report difficulties with command-and-control management hierarchies above them [3]. From these issues comes a question:

This observation intersects with AI's narrative about automating production of visible work, while ignoring the much larger work context.

"It’s distressingly common for bureaucratized systems to focus on a minute subset of an organization’s problems. Generally, these efforts are directed at improving the workers’ performance via objectives, performance reviews, and rankings. Unfortunately, this focus is often misplaced because the workers form only a fraction of the overall problems."
