I see this sentiment unquestioningly expressed in nearly every breathless AI hype piece, across every domain:

> "AI would transform their jobs, freeing them up from mundane tasks to focus on more meaningful ones" (<https://www.fastcompany.com/90963356/will-ai-make-ceos-obsolete>)

I doubt this. The ascent of asynchronous electronic communication over the past 30 years hasn't liberated people from time-consuming synchronous meetings.  If anything, the reduction in async communication costs has increased each role's scope and tempo.

Without adjusting communication patterns, increased scope at higher tempo is more likely to produce more meetings to ensure alignment or course correct.

Additionally, to the extent that the prevailing work metaphor is mechanistic/Taylorisic, whatever new capacity is freed by adopting AI will be quickly backfilled by a new set of rote work.

Innovation, relationship building, and experimentation are inherently unpredictable. Many organizations prioritize and reward the illusion of control and predictability over existential uncertainty and potential upside.

There's a reason it's "Team Hackathon Day" and not "Business Unit Experimentation Year".

AI adoption is a self-fulfilling prophecy that's more likely to raise the expectations for individuals, as existing tasks will be perceived to be less costly in terms of time or skill. What is harder to measure is the cost of maintaining quality levels. Fewer people will be expected to do more, more quickly, while their newly expanded role has partially shifted from creator to editor/auditor.

The AI as Liberator is a seductive theme. However, I think it's only likely to make good on this lofty goal if the social environment changes accordingly. Technology is socially constructed and those social forces can be disrupted without technological adoption.

Closing the loop - equating meaningful work with AI attentional direction in the face of communication overload…so that you can do your job properly.

“In the future, rather than increasing the amount of information we’re expected to handle, technology will help to create more personalized experiences. It will strip away the noise leaving only what’s important. Relevance will be king”

Meaningful work is often work co-created with other people in service of a shared goal. Creating an environment that fosters meaningful work can be done today, with or without AI.

"The result is millions of forks with names identical to the original one that add a payload that’s wrapped under seven layers of obfuscation. To make matters worse, some people, unaware of the malice of these imitators, are forking the forks, which adds to the flood."

"To all the recruiters in the world: The truth is, while some of you are certainly predatory and untrustworthy, I firmly believe the majority of you aren't trying to take advantage of anybody. That's the good news. The bad news is, we still don't trust you. And the main reason we don't trust you is because we don't trust your process."

"GenAI helps developers create more code faster, which in turn increases productivity. However, recent research out of GitClear found a decrease in code quality due to an over-reliance on GitHub Copilot.

More doesn’t equal better, that research found. Generative AI’s response is based on the probability of being accepted, not on its accuracy...This makes it challenging for long-term maintainability and it could indeed create more technical debt."
