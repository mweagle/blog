"The difference between these two flows is subtle but staggering. Building my blog's backend with the old flow could take up to 10 minutes. Building my blog's backend with Earthly takes tens of seconds. The old flow produced a 734 MB image with a bunch of extraneous dependencies (even though that should be mathematically impossible). The new flow shits out a 262 MB image that has only what is required to run the blog."

"For example, a big question to ask amidst all the reports and charts that one sees in a board meeting is: what's being measured? Are the right things being measured, and if so, are we doing so accurately? Which important things can't be measured at all? Who have we listened to or consulted in choosing what we measure?"

“Think and care about the content first. Because that’s what the users care about. Assume the users’ interests are more important than your own.”

“The ability to recognize that your wins might not signal that you did anything right in the same way your losses might not signal you did anything wrong is vital to learning something valuable from real-world feedback.”
