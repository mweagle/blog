â€œWhat Iâ€™m really doing is changing the engineering culture at OpenSesame. Culture doesnâ€™t change easily. It tends to snap back. True change involves changing hundreds of little day-to-day decisions. Thatâ€™s hard, even when people want to make those changes, and full buy-in is hard to come by.â€

â€œThe Golden Path â€” as we define it today â€” is the â€˜opinionated and supportedâ€™ path to â€˜build somethingâ€™ (for example, build a backend service, put up a website, create a data pipeline).

â€œIf the timeframe is less than a month, don't hire anyone--you won't get the ROI. If the timeframe is less than 6 months, hire the senior--you won't get the ROI from the juniors in that short a timeframe. Otherwise, hire the juniors.â€

â€œI've used lots of bad websites in my life. Hell, I've made a lot of bad websites in my life. But never before have I seen a website that so completely expresses just the pure hatred of users like this one. Everything was as poorly designed as possible, with user hostile design at every corner.â€

â€œThe real problem here is the same one that plagued the pre-SS7 phone network: the commingling of data and commands. As long as the dataâ€”whether it be training data, text prompts, or other input into the LLMâ€”is mixed up with the commands that tell the LLM what to do, the system will be vulnerable.â€
