There's no intrinsic point at which activity towards progress and exploration becomes costs applied to failures and legacy.

“This is another way in which failure is a performance art: sometimes, the fact that we can afford to fail means that we can afford to take risks.”

Know your audience & don’t bury the lead.

“Zooming out a bit, this is a classic “lack of user empathy” problem. Folks authoring the document are so deep in the details that they can’t put themselves in the readers’ mindset to think about how overwhelming the document would be if you were simply trying to pop in, get an answer, and then pop out.”

Related:

- Go slow to go fast.

- We can do many things. We can’t do everything at the same time.

“But I wanted to remind people that when things are working, things can be simpler. They need to be because that's the only way you'll get anything done.”

This is an excellent article.

“What that emphasis on day-to-day tasks suggested is that AI isn’t so much going to produce a grand new world as, depending on your perspective, make what exists now slightly more efficient—or, rather, intensify and solidify the structure of the present. Yes, some parts of your job might be easier, but what seems likely is that those automated tasks will in turn simply be part of more work.”

“Actually, that’s the root of my org’s current capacity problems. They weren’t cheating a metric, but they were under pressure to deliver as much as possible. So they deferred a bunch of maintenance and took some questionable engineering shortcuts. Now they’re paying the price.”
