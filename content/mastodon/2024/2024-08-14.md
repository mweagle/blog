Gemini, what's a good illustration of survivorship bias?

“Google decided that work-life balance and going home early and working from home was more important than winning,” Schmidt said at Stanford. “The reason startups work is because the people work like hell.”

“A large fraction of information/decision meetings is sadly a waste of time. They lack a clear objective and often amount to a recitation of somewhat random bits of information. Going forward I will ask for a lot more preparation in long-form writing. Sometimes the act of writing will obviate the need for such a meeting entirely as the decision will become clear.”

“If you want to lead geeks effectively, at whatever scale, you need to be a person & interact with them as people. You need to build, maintain, & repair relationships. You need to be vulnerable while setting boundaries. You need to pay attention & exercise judgement. The foundation is person-to-person, in spite of the power differential.”
