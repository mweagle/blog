Inefficient and unconscious use of an organization’s collective time and attention is problematic. Meetings can be an effective way to squander that capacity.

I doubt that expecting AI to extract meaning from cognitive overload will improve the situation.

“And with this change comes a world of uncertainty and anxiety where predictable performance for any business seems more and more like Deming’s red bead experiment: random. The results can be devastating to a business. The worker no longer trusts that they won’t be a replaced by a machine. The investor no longer trusts that they will get a return on capital. The manager no longer trusts that they will have employment for life after more than a bad quarter or two.”
