The customer friction introduced by "Setup a 30 minute phone call to learn more" is massive. You may be able to infer the behavior from website analytics, but it won't show up in customer journey funnels.

Betteridge's law in 3…2…1…

“And businesses around the world are scrambling to co-opt AI for their needs. The tech works—isn’t that enough?”

Large language models can do jaw-dropping things. But nobody knows exactly why. <https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/03/04/1089403/large-language-models-amazing-but-nobody-knows-why/>

“As soon as we moved to the CeleryExecutor, despite solving one of our problems, new things started to go wrong. After a few days (or even hours) running, some of our Celery workers started dying from OOM (Out of Memory) problems.”

“I suppose if I had to attempt to summarize a lot of the key themes here when it comes to dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity, there are a few things that emerge for me: understanding the problem, empathy, communication, and that I did better than I thought I did.”

“The catalyst leader will be able to help others create the best result. She will use tools like facilitation and coaching to continuously improve how the team is working. This leadership style requires maturity and letting go of control.”

"What does this mean practically? Large language models can often give useful answers to broad questions — questions on topics they’ve seen articulated millions of times — but they become increasingly unreliable as you ask more specific questions."

I've also read similar how LLMs have a disproportionately beneficial impact for novices which tapers off for experts.  I suspect experts are asking much more targeted context-specific questions (if they ask them at all) relative to novices.

"When I generally ask people the question of “What level of maturity do you want to be one year from now as an organization or team?”, most people by default respond they wish to be at Level 3(Proactive). I want to caution that not all teams and organizations have to be at Level 3 to be successful as a product."

I agree with the general sentiment of this article. I also think that our use of Lakoff-conceptual metaphors and representations not being reflections of an external ontology but a communal negotiation is going to be challenging for conversational interfaces.

We agree that these representations are "equivalent" in some meaningful way.

"One thing I slipped into the conversation above is that the text and the map are simply different views of the same thing."
