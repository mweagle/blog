“All of the methodologies that can be considered "top down" are the result of our desire to have a rational, systematic way of designing software. This paper brings a message with both bad news and good news. The bad news is that, in our opinion, we will never find the philosopher's stone. We will never find a process that allows us to design software in a perfectly rational way. The good news is that we can fake it.“

TL;DR; Focus on documentation

“The process is "faked" by producing the documents that we would have produced if we had done things the ideal way…The documentation is our medium of design and no design decisions are considered to be made until their incorporation into the documents.”

Wisdom from 1986

And a great quote to end it: “Those who read the software documentation want to understand the programs, not to relive their discovery.”

Good survey paper that includes ethical considerations ("neutral" demographic data is biased) and the importance of interpretability for ML deployments.

"Many pain points we have described in this work were already experienced by communities in these fields, and the ML community should turn to them for solutions and inspiration.”

Some of these challenges are shared with normal software engineering practices, but others are unique to ML.

This closing observation highlights the distance between theory and practice:

"As an observation that follows from the process of collecting papers to review in this survey, we note the relative shortage of deployment experience reports in the academic literature.”

If a developer experience initiative attempts to provide developers with new and adaptive strategies, but the larger context then invalidates the behaviors by which a person can execute those strategies, psychological outcomes may be more negative than not intervening in the first place.”

Nice to see one of the sharpest go corners being rounded off:

"In Go 1.22, each iteration of the loop creates new variables, to avoid accidental sharing bugs”
