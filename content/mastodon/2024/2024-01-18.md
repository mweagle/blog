This should be interesting…

“Paradoxically, we found that developers appreciate the value of header comments and estimate that they are worth the investment in time, but nevertheless they tend not to write such documentation in their own code. Reasons for not writing header comments vary from the belief that code should be self-documenting to concern that documentation will not be kept up-to-date.”

“Two said that documentation is forbidden”

Didn’t expect this.

“It is important to apply judgment, and only document functions that need it — either because they are part of an API or because they are complex. An easy test is to verify that you have what to say beyond the obvious from the function declaration. In these cases, it is important to apply documentation guidelines which correspond to what developers want and need, especially regarding the provision of examples of usage.”

It's performance rating season again!

IME many IC dev career paths emphasize "technical mastery over a complex or complicated domain." Evidence of technical mastery biases towards an individual's digital artifacts rather than their discretion or restraint. This creates conditions where promo projects, premature internal complexity, and NIH syndrome flourish. Digital artifacts & activity metrics easily satisfy the Availability Heuristic.

_The Complexity Came from Inside the House_ is a reasonable outcome given these conditions. Acknowledging the Availability Heuristic and/or looking for ways to exploit it (<https://github.com/adr> ?) may help nudge things to a Less is More footing without impacting IC career growth.
