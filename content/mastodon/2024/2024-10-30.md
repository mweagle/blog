Trying to write a bit more and starting with a paper summary to kickoff. There are familiar themes including ‚Äúshifting left" in the design/delivery process, Work-As-Imagined versus Work-As-Done, why newfound organizational capacity is reliably consumed, and unintentional yet predictable consequences of technical change.

How it started: I'm enjoying this paper. I should writeup a summary.

How it's going: battling JS and documenting a shortcode for embedding Apache ECharts on Hugo static sites.

How it finished up...

An Apache ECharts Sankey flow example of Todd Conklin's 5 Principles of Human Performance.

Why? At this point I've spent too much time fighting syntax and various levels of escaping to remember. But it seemed like it might be fun when I started.
