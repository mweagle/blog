Agree & I wonder how the dialog would be different if we spoke about a demand funnel rather than a supply chain.

“We’ve learned that we know much less about the integrity of our software systems than we thought. We’ve learned that supply chain attacks on open source software can start very far upstream—indeed, at the stream’s source.”

“In my opinion, a better basis is state space explosion. Concurrency is hard because concurrent systems can be in a lot of different possible states, and the number of states grows much faster than anyone is prepared for.”

"All of this is very sad, because it’s not clear which path forward makes sense in this new landscape for me as a builder if I want to now use Redis in a new project, particularly since neither of the new projects support modules like Redis Search yet.”

"This approach requires that you design for evolution, or said another way, that you treat evolvability as a first-class requirement."

"So it’s critical that the AI product manager ensures that the technology is a good match for the specific product or solution.

This leads directly to the critical topic of quality assurance.  What are acceptable error rates?  What are the possible types of mistakes?  How will the product handle each type of mistake? Are there ways to mitigate mistakes with the user experience?"
