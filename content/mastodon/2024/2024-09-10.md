“The operating environment has changed from a high tolerance for failure (where cheap capital and willing spenders accepted slipped dates and feature lag) to a very low - if not zero - tolerance for failure (fiscal discipline is in vogue again).”

How can a prompt be incomplete?

“Prompt clarity impacted the likelihood of generating bugs: The clarity and completeness of the prompt provided to the LLM significantly impacted the likelihood of generating bugs. Ambiguous or incomplete prompts led to a higher incidence of misinterpretations and missing corner cases.”

“But this response is exactly the reason why safety first will always be a lie. Production pressure is an unavoidable reality for all organizations. Because of this, the system will always push back against delays, and that includes delays for the benefit of safety. This means engineers will always face double binds, where they will feel pressure to execute on schedule, but will be punished if they make decisions that facilitate execution but reduce safety.”

“This experience probably reflects a fundamental limitation of language models. After all, they aren’t “intelligent” as such. Until we know otherwise, they’re just predicting what should come next based on analysis of the training data.”

“If you’re in a hybrid environment like this now, as so many of us are now, pay attention to how often the remote people contribute to the conversation. Notice how often we even forget that they’re on the call and only remember the people we can see.”
