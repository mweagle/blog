"At this point, we knew it had punched well above our weight, and attempted to take our package down, in an effort to prevent further harm we might inadvertently cause. Only problem is, in attempting to install, and by extension, depend on everything, we depended on ourselves."

"The best leaders I’ve worked with have always been open to dissenting voices. They’ve always been willing to listen to the other side of the argument, and to engage with it, even if they’re not willing to change their mind. The playbook is simple: be transparent, open, and accountable."

Even if this were sufficient, who/what is supposed to fund and be liable for this?

"We hope this preview of Voice Engine both underscores its potential and also motivates the need to bolster societal resilience against the challenges brought by ever more convincing generative models. Specifically, we encourage steps like:…

* Educating the public in understanding the capabilities and limitations of AI technologies, including the possibility of deceptive AI content"

“So, you’re thinking of building a new thing. It’s going to be a lot like that other thing that already exists. In fact, it seems so similar that lots of folks are asking you why you’re building a new thing rather than using that existing thing, or maybe adapting that existing thing to your needs.”

“But to quote a cleaning equipment manufacturer: “If you don’t schedule time for maintenance, your equipment will schedule it for you”. Things that are not regularly maintained will break in the most inopportune time possible.”

“Natural language is ambigious and not suitable for programming. LLMs still need to generate code to get things done. If not inspected carefully, this incurs tech debt at monumental speed of the computers. The natural language prompts are not repeatable/deterministic, they are subject to breaking any time. This makes "natural language programming" unsuitable for even small sized projects, let alone medium to large projects.”

“The root problem is that, for the first time in human history, our brain is the bottleneck. For all history, transmitting information was slow. Brains were fasts. After sending a letter, we had days or months to think before receiving an answer.”

“This sets up a virtuous cycle: over time, these activities allow him to complete his assigned work even faster, allowing him even more discretionary time without needing to adjust his estimates1. Ultimately, he gains the ability to complete tasks much faster than an “ordinary” engineer, leading to dramatic2 results in a crisis.”
