<p>Q: “Is AI driving efficiency or fueling burnout?” (<a href="https://www.upwork.com/research/ai-enhanced-work-models" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">upwork.com/research/ai-enhance</span><span class="invisible">d-work-models</span></a>)</p><p>A: “The Rise of the Triple Peak Day” (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/triple-peak-day" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/tr</span><span class="invisible">iple-peak-day</span></a>)</p><p>An increase in output that&#39;s correlated with increasing an input (time) is not a productivity increase. It is an increase in aggregate output.</p>

<p>The Upwork writeup reads like it&#39;s trying to maximize cognitive dissonance:</p><p>- &quot;While 69% of C-suite leaders admit they’re aware that employees are struggling to keep up with productivity demands, 84% are adamant their companies value employee well-being over productivity.”</p>

<p>- &quot;Employees are just as excited about the potential of AI as their leaders, with 65% believing these technologies can increase productivity…Nearly half (47%) of workers using AI say they have no idea how to achieve the productivity gains their employers expect.”</p>

<p>- &quot;One in two executives at companies using AI believe their company is falling behind their competitors (51%) and that their workforce’s overall productivity levels are stalled due to lack of employee skills and adoption (50%)... Thirty-seven percent of C-suite leaders at companies that use AI said their workforce is “highly” skilled and comfortable with these tools, but only 17% of employees actually reported this level of skill and comfort. “</p>

<p>This pivot was predictable: </p><p>”We risk another productivity paradox with generative AI if we don’t fundamentally rethink the way we work.”</p><p>Well, that sounds interesting at least. Maybe a Cal Newport vibe is incoming…I wonder what they think that might look like:</p><p>&quot;1. Leverage nontraditional talent</p><p>When compared with full-time employees, more freelancers claim to be AI-ready.”</p>
