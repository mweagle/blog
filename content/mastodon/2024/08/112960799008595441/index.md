<p>‚ÄúA large fraction of information/decision meetings is sadly a waste of time. They lack a clear objective and often amount to a recitation of somewhat random bits of information. Going forward I will ask for a lot more preparation in long-form writing. Sometimes the act of writing will obviate the need for such a meeting entirely as the decision will become clear.‚Äù</p><p><a href="https://continuations.com/post/758733140038664192" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">continuations.com/post/7587331</span><span class="invisible">40038664192</span></a></p>
