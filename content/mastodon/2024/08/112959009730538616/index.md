<p>“If you want to lead geeks effectively, at whatever scale, you need to be a person &amp; interact with them as people. You need to build, maintain, &amp; repair relationships. You need to be vulnerable while setting boundaries. You need to pay attention &amp; exercise judgement. The foundation is person-to-person, in spite of the power differential.”</p><p><a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/humans-data" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">tidyfirst.substack.com/p/human</span><span class="invisible">s-data</span></a></p>
