“Instead, as a result of the lack of understanding, many orgs expect that their engineering teams will miraculously “make time” in their fully allocated and often over-subscribed schedules. That is not possible, and when production suffers, we all suffer. (insert meme with person riding bike, then falling from their own mistakes, wincing in pain on the ground, painfully expressing “Why would the code do this to us?")”

I hope the research pans out and we can look forward to zero-shot anomaly detection tooling. But the headline leans too much into the hype.

From the abstract: “Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.”
