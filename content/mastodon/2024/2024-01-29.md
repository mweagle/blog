"The kicker is that across the industry, the perception of this Google-originating process isn’t necessarily any better than that of what it sought to replace. At a great cost, we merely traded the accusations of manager-level favoritism for grander conspiracy theories — sinister corporate agendas divined from the garbled words of secretive, shapeless committees.”

[@thudfactor](https://hachyderm.io/@thudfactor) Also related ICYMI:

'And the leadership is mostly about perfecting yourself. It's not about beating anybody, but the theory is that if you perfect yourself and somehow rays come out of your head and people will follow you, because you're so magnetic, and you're so perfect, and you're so wonderful, and you're so insightful, and that people will follow you, you won't ever have to say, "[inaudible 01:17:19 {Don’t}], do that.”’

Roofing with a power nailer makes this type of issue more likely. Feedback is both quicker and less frequent vs. driving a nail with a hammer. It's *very* obvious using hand tools when I miss sinking the nail into the rafter.

But the owner can't see the difference from the outside. It’s “done” and the worker using the power nailer probably was “more productive" installing the roof than me with a hammer.

However, there are windstorms in the forecast.

🧟‍♂️ leadership

“As with economics, the ideas about leadership that prove particularly hard to kill are those that simplify a knotty social process while at the same time legitimizing the privileges of social elites and the leadership industrial complex that supports them — a complex of self-aggrandizing personal coaching, expensive development programs, and glossy business magazines.”

People trying to figure out what is going on are not committing errors.

“The abundance of possibilities makes it challenging for On-Call Engineers (OCEs) to pinpoint the exact cause of the incidents. Errors made during the root cause analysis not only result in additional effort and labor but also have a direct impact on customers and revenue. It is essential to avoid such human errors to minimize disruptions and provide a better experience to customers.”
