[@thudfactor](https://hachyderm.io/@thudfactor) That is awesome, old-school Internet style!

I've been using Hasklig for a long time & may need to switch up.

[@thudfactor](https://hachyderm.io/@thudfactor) Yes - I liked this article a lot. It's beneficial to spend time creating future capacity and loose coupling. Incentivizing speed and predictability/control over capacity is tempting because of vastly different measurement costs. It is high risk and over time (which seems at odds with short-term financial incentives) pays off hugely. Whether managers have personal or organizational support to take those risks is going to be very context-specific.

“Each of these cycles has been larger and lasted longer than the last, and I want to be clear: each cycle has produced genuinely useful technology. It’s just that each follows the progress of a sigmoid curve that everyone mistakes for an exponential one.”
