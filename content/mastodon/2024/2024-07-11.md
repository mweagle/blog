The Comcast automated support is poor, but shout out to the subcontracted team that showed up this morning to resolve:

- Fixed the line

- Upgraded the modem to improve performance (which I independently verified - nice!)

- Lowered my monthly bill

- Removed the box of old HW

Outstanding

“What is the current problem definition? Where did the current problem definition come from? What could be wrong with it? What are two alternative problem definitions, allowing us to explore the value framing a bit? And notice that answering these questions requires discovery. Again, we’ve been trained that discovery is waste—our job is to shut up and deliver.”

“Selling a point-solution for a point-problem is easier than getting people to change how they live their lives. Identifying specific pain points and explaining how your software addresses those is easier than trying to tap into a general malaise and promising a better world.”

Alternative take: Because technical writing is devalued, LLMs fill a gap for novices to learn new areas and for seniors to map stable ontologies across languages. LLMs are non-judgmental, patient, and can be made context-aware. They will not tell you if the questions being asked are relevant to defining or addressing a problem.

I’m really not sure what this means:

“Filters over 75% hallucinated responses for RAG and summarization workloads”

Is a 25% hallucination rate acceptable for production use?

“Someone asked me about my management philosophy recently, and after I stopped panicking (I wrote a book, I should have a philosphy… how do you summarize 400 pages and 2 years of your life in one sentence) I came up with:

“My job is to make it easier for people to make good decisions.”

“As he points out in his theory of graceful extensibility, resilient systems require that agents within a system lend out resources to each other in times of need. But the natural inclination of management to incentivize efficiency pushes the system in the exact opposite direction. This leads to behaviors that Woods and Branlat refer to as locally adaptive but globally maladaptive.”

“So, then, how do we enable our SEs to be better communicators? I believe that the best way is to appeal to their analytic, compositional mindsets – those same mindsets that enable them to write and analyze code. And I believe that the best way to appeal to those analytic, compositional mindsets is to teach them how to analyze the composition of communicative artifacts.”

“Basically, I believe that we should teach SEs about rhetorical situations, and about the elements of rhetorical situations that interact to create communicative artifacts: author, intended audience, text, purpose, and context.”
