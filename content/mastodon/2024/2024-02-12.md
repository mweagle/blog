"From the beginning I made some core decisions that the company has had to stick to, for better or worse, these past four years. This post will list some of the major decisions made and if I endorse them for your startup, or if I regret them and advise you to pick something else."

The author calls out a pain point I've encountered and also invested in addressing in multiple teams:

"With GitOps we’ve had to invest in tooling to help people answer questions like “I did a commit: why isn’t it deployed yet”."

- Product always wants to know when a feature will be available

- Dev always wants to know what's running when a test a test fails

- Ops always wants to know what version of code/artifact is running during an incident.

Confidence is not competence. Amplitude is not ability.

"Here's the problem, however. Instead of figuring out how to tap into the incredible potential of the Maria's, companies:

* Hear the loud voices in the room, with strong opinions about what is broken. You are missing out on a whole source of information about how to fix the problem."
