My history of predictions is that I'm typically wrong, but I'm willing to bet everything this won't happen:

"AI and Web3 are two sides of the same coin. AI will help make web3 usable for mainstream applications and web3 will help us trust AI.”

“Like for the email spammers, the cost of this ends up in the receiving end. The ease of use and wide access to powerful LLMs is just too tempting. I strongly suspect we will get more LLM generated rubbish in our Hackerone inboxes going forward.”

“With that settled up, let's take a look at what I think will happen across calendar year 2024. As I've done with my predictions, I'm including a probability score with each one, in much the same way intelligence officials do in their assessment reports, to give you a sense of how confident I am in the prediction.”

From a personal perspective, optimistic this prediction is on point:

“But with the new year, and a bit of optimism in the market, they'll start growing new branches to that tree, and that will require more in the way of engineering management and "ancillary units" like developer relations, R&D, and so on. It'll take a while, and it'll never be like 2019, but before too long things will get stronger.”

Excellent suggestions for making communication and context explicit.

“Durable communication exhibits the same characteristics as accidental, convenient

communication in a co-located space. The powerful difference is how inclusive, transparent, and reliable it is. Durable communication tools and techniques not only scale well with your organization, they'll empower your organization scale well, too.”

“Consider that you may never complete that refactoring, and think about what the application will look like with two different ways of doing the same thing. Will this aid those coming after you, or hinder them? What happens if your way turns out to be sub-optimal? Will replacing it be easy? Or would it have been better to leave the older, but more consistent code in place?”

“A cold-blooded project uses boring technology. The build and test scripts don’t depend on external services that might change, break, or disappear entirely. It uses vendored dependencies.”

“Beyond the showy disruptions generated by the pandemic’s arrival was a more subtle but arguably even more important trend: a sharp increase in how much time the average knowledge worker engages in digital communication. A recent report from Microsoft found that users of its office-productivity software now spend close to sixty per cent of their time using digital communication tools…with only the remaining forty per cent left for “creation” software...”

“That’s because, in an effective team, the individual strengths merge to form a collective understanding much higher than the sum of the parts. And so no team member could either design or build such a large system on their own, regardless of the time they have available, and yet the team can.”

“Times of high stress on a system, with a lot of changes, are the worst times for things to get slower. Getting slower means queues get longer, just like they do in a barista-powered café. However, unlike a queue in a café, these system queues can set off a spiral of doom. As the system gets slower, clients retry, which makes the system slower still.”
