“Time has certainly proved Dr Gabriel correct. Systems of the New Jersey school so dominate the modern computing industry that the other way of writing software is banished to a tiny niche.”

“Although each movement started in different places, they all agree on one thing: WIP is the silent killer. Therefore, one of the most critical mechanisms in the management of any plant is job and materials release.”

“That’s the optimism: that with some effort we can make sure that the good of technology outweighs the bad. But Andreessen’s version is that we should just ignore the bad and the good will magically wipe out all the bad. That’s not just simplistic, it’s ahistorical, as his own example with nuclear power proves.”

“Another simpler alternative is more pragmatic, and can be achieved readily with most taxonomies: neutralise the taxonomy. This involves removing adjectives and prefixes such as ‘poor’, ‘inadequate’, ‘incorrect’, ‘inappropriate’, ‘mis-‘, ‘error’, ‘violation’, and ‘failure’. So terms such as ‘incorrect decision’, ‘poor teamwork’, and ‘inadequate supervision’ become ‘decision’, ‘teamwork’, and ‘supervision’. These are not hindsight-based evaluative labels…”

“We periodically update our forecast, as soon as we discover new facts, and we reflect the updated forecast to the other party to make sure that expectations are aligned. We do that using terms such as “time left” to indicate that progress has been made and progress still has to be made.”

“What’s been most surprising so far is that I originally thought “to understand Git, people just need to learn git’s internal data model!“. But the more I talk to people about their struggles with Git, the less I think that’s true.”

"The Limiting Beliefs:

1. If improvement is easy, something is wrong.

2. Change must be hard. The only time "big changes" are possible is when there are big changes. It has to be hard."

Work-As-Imagined is always more effective, elegant, and persuasive than the messy reality of Work-As-Done (<https://humanisticsystems.com/2016/12/05/the-varieties-of-human-work>).

It's like those breakfast pancake commercials that show extra thick maple syrup...which is thick because it's motor oil.

"What changed?

Growth slowed. When companies transition from high growth to slow growth or begin shrinking it isn’t just a small change, it needs a fundamentally different approach to management and the culture of the company...Adding headcount and budget every year covers up all kind of problems, it brings a flexibility to operations that becomes part of the culture."
