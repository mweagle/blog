“What keeps the software alive are the programmers who have an accurate mental model (theory) of how it is built and works. That mental model can only be learned by having worked on the project while it grew or by working alongside somebody who did, who can help you absorb the theory. Replace enough of the programmers, and their mental models become disconnected from the reality of the code, and the code dies.”

“Even though the results are exciting, the ingredients for them are not. They’re all really simple things. The best designed production systems I’ve ever used take the same basic idea: build exciting things out of boring components that are well understood across all facets of the industry”

“Today, the Forest Service’s seasonal workforce is in jeopardy. The agency recently announced that they will not hire seasonal or temporary workers next fiscal year due to a sweeping budget crisis, leaving thousands of people out of work and putting vital conservation and recreation work at risk. “

"The original 2014 worker manager was an entirely in-memory process, which was great for latency and allowed it to optimize across a broad segment of the workload. The downside to it was that if a worker manager machine failed all that in-memory state was lost, and it was very expensive to reconstruct. We ended up redesigning worker manager to be persistent across AZs, and doing that while decreasing median latency was really challenging.”

"Executives who are losing their grip consistently demonstrate what I call uncontrolled lateness – tardiness or lack of follow-through due to a systemic breakdown of control. Uncontrolled lateness manifests in two main ways.”

“The historical performance of your service is what we call the implicit SLO. People, over time, come to expect what you’ve been doing previously will continue into the future. The danger is when you change your behaviour and violate people’s expectations.”

“This post was just a toy exercise using synthetic data, but I hope it demonstrates how, if incident durations are power-law distributed, looking at MTTR trends over time will lead to incorrect conclusions.”
