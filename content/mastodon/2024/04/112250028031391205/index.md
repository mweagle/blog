<p>“And with this change comes a world of uncertainty and anxiety where predictable performance for any business seems more and more like Deming’s red bead experiment: random.

The manager no longer trusts that they will have employment for life after more than a bad quarter or two.”</p><p><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/06/the-management-thinker-we-should-never-have-forgotten" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">hbr.org/2016/06/the-management</span><span class="invisible">-thinker-we-should-never-have-forgotten</span></a></p>
