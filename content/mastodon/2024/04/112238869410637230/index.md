<p>“In hindsight, it&#39;s clear the project and the maintainer were struggling. He was working alone for years. He had a bug tracker and a mailing list that were both filled with aggressive and demanding outsiders. And he had no one to help. No backup, no plan for succession, nothing. The thing that alarms me about the situation is that no one found this alarming at the time.”</p><p><a href="https://jenniferplusplus.com/the-free-software-commons/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">jenniferplusplus.com/the-free-</span><span class="invisible">software-commons/</span></a></p>
