<p>The subtext I&#39;m reading is that Rust is more likely to produce secure code than C++ (which seems reasonable), but the security improvements weren&#39;t enough to motivate the language change. The headline is that Rust teams are twice as productive than C++ teams and felt more confident in the correctness of their changes. </p><p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/31/rust_google_c/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">theregister.com/2024/03/31/rus</span><span class="invisible">t_google_c/</span></a></p>

<p>This applies to C++ to Rust rewrites, so it might be attributed to extracting and re-implementing the functionality, the beneficial psychological effects of group learning, and/or the Hawthorne effect. But - this productivity gain is only after a long period of reduced productivity: &quot;That is, in two months about a third of devs feel they&#39;re as productive in their new language as their old one. And in about four months, half of developers say as much, based on anonymous internal surveys.&quot;</p>

<p>Whether a technology change &quot;increases productivity&quot;, which in itself is less important than whether we&#39;re &quot;increasing effectiveness&quot;, often depends on when and how it&#39;s measured. There is a version of this story that proclaims that &quot;Teams that adopt Rust are less productive than C++ teams...After Two Months&quot;. This could be enough to thwart the migration in organizations that didn&#39;t reach consensus on intermediate checkpoints and directional signals.</p>

<p>Compared to improved security (which often exploits FUD or counterfactuals), promised dev productivity improvements are more likely to receive organizational funding. But those big bets have big risks, so it&#39;s critical to make sure in advance we agree how long things might take and the signals we&#39;ll use to pivot, proceed, or pause.</p>
