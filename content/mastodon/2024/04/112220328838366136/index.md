<p>A good Chaos Monkey thought experiment to vet one aspect of the onboarding plan:</p><p>1. All team members received new machines. They do not have access to their old ones.<br />2. A fresh zero-day was just announced.<br />3. How long might it take us to determine if we&#39;re exposed and if we are, how long until we confirm it&#39;s addressed in everywhere in production?</p><p><a href="https://hachyderm.io/@mekkaokereke/112219016968211952" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">hachyderm.io/@mekkaokereke/112</span><span class="invisible">219016968211952</span></a></p>

<p>Like GameDays that reveal CC spending limits or conference call participation limits, it&#39;s maybe not surprising how often ”I have a shell shortcut”, “It’s in my browser bookmarks&quot;, or &quot;I have a GreaseMonkey script” are the load-bearing exclusionary workflow pieces.</p>
