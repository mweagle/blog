“But the current crop of AI leadership is absolutely unsuited to this work. They are themselves shameless, grasping at venture capital and talking about how their products will run the world, asking for billions or even trillions in investment. They insist we remake civilization around them and promise it will work out. But how are they going to teach a computer to behave if they can’t?”

“Any time you have a lag time and some amount of uncertainty, you will get oscillation as you constantly overshoot and then undershoot the balance point. If you’ve ever dealt with a shower that takes a particularly long time for the temperature to adjust, you’ll have an intuitive understanding of why this is. This means that the best practice is to make multiple small nudges over time instead of one big shift all at once.”

“By making the overhead of deployment vanishingly small, they could create value with every deployment. Either the deployment was fine, in which case the engineer regained confidence, or the deployment broke, in which case the engineer learned something about the sensitivities of the system.”

“So we come to the big question: How were the private cloud(s) deleted? The press release makes heroic use of the passive voice to obscure the actors: “an unprecedented sequence of events whereby an inadvertent misconfiguration during provisioning of UniSuper’s Private Cloud services ultimately resulted in the deletion of UniSuper’s Private Cloud subscription.””

“The core of coaching is deep respect, mutual trust, and an exciting partnership with the client. All of these equally apply to manager/report relationships. The idea that there should be a certain distance to “maintain respect”, for example, runs completely counter to all the relevant neuroscience research of the last few decades.”
