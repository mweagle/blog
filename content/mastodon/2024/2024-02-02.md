“Instead, I thought about cults. Specifically, about a term first defined by psychologist Robert Lifton in his early writing on cult dynamics: “voluntary self-surrender.” This is what happens when people hand over their agency and the power to make decisions about their own lives to a guru.”

[@darkuncle](https://infosec.exchange/@darkuncle) srsly - didn’t anyone stop to think that “exploiting social relations and status” isn’t a good thing?

Channeling Bill Lumbergh: yeah, I’m gonna go ahead and sort of disagree with you there.

“Other game mechanics look for exploiting social relations and status, as in the case of levels, leaderboards, or voting. Many gamification applications also make use of feedback systems that provide the users with continuous information on their performance at a given task. The workplace is a very attractive target for gamification.”

“Backlogs grow without bound unless they are culled. 1000 tickets is the same as 100 tickets, except that you haven’t identified which 10% are most important. Which means you’re definitely not working on the most important ones. But if you delete things, it will sometimes turn out we needed to do it after all.”

“This brings us to the greenfield fallacy. In short, the greenfield fallacy is only reasoning about writing new code, neglecting what it means to modify existing code. This misconception could be rooted partially in the continuous comparison of software with physical goods”

“But to thrive in that new industry, programmers will need to know more about architecture, more about design, more about human relations—and we’re only starting to see that in our data, primarily for topics like product management and communications skills. And perhaps that’s the definition of “disruptive”: when our systems and our expectations change faster than our ability to keep up.”

“It’s possible that understanding patterns seems less important when AI is writing a lot of the code for you. It’s also possible that design patterns seem less relevant when code is already largely written; most programmers maintain existing applications rather than develop new greenfield apps, and few texts about design patterns discuss the patterns that are embedded in legacy applications.”
