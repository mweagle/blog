“The reality is that CAP is nearly irrelevant for almost all engineers building cloud-style distributed systems, and applications on the cloud. It’s much closer to relevant for developers of intermittently connected mobile and IoT applications, and space where the trade-off is typically seen as common sense already.”

“It’s worth looking out for garbage collection as a potential cause of metastable behavior in open request-response systems. Both language-level GCs and similar systems (e.g. pool or arena allocators, uses of reference counting, etc) can display this behavior.”

“It’s just that, for a software engineer to estimate a global 30 year positive impact for a nascent technology because that person has had a positive individual experience with the technology, doesn’t mean a lot. This is a key takeaway for my students from the estimation exercise.”

Looking forward to listening to the recording…

“Understanding and caring about technical details: Take time to learn about the technical aspects of projects. Even a basic understanding shows respect for the complexity of the work and helps facilitate better communication and decision-making.”

“Remote work highlighted or exacerbated existing issues. Teams (or companies) with poor management practices (extremely common) no longer had the structure of an office as a forcing function for baseline communication.”

“Whether this approach is a power grab, hubris, or something else, it’s almost never a good idea. As a rule, you should only be replacing your SaaS products with internal tools if you’re FAANG-sized or if you can replace the tools with a spreadsheet.

Let’s talk about why.”

“Then the company scales, and you try to delegate. But without the unifying thread of clear direction and maintenance over time, everyone’s running in different directions. You conclude the problem was delegating at all, when really it was just that you didn’t know how to keep everyone on track.”

“The point is not that the status quo is always right, that every fence should remain standing. Rather, it’s that reform should be preceded by understanding and that critique should be informed by context.“
