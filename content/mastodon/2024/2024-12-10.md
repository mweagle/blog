â€œThis year, the Careful Industries team has spent a lot of time working with non-technical organisations who are figuring out their approach to AI.

While weâ€™ll eventually figure out whatâ€™s going on, weâ€™ll still struggle in the face of conflicting signals, as anyone who has responded to an incident can tell you. And in high-tempo situations, where we need to respond quickly enough or something terrible will happenâ€¦we simply might not be able to respond quickly enough.â€

Related & IIRC, Sydney Dekker shared a story in one of his books about a ship accident.  The sensor state was correct, but the operator didn't detect the state change because it was so rare. This led into a discussion about <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inattentional_blindness>
