“With these prerequisites in place, you’re now ready to implement a secure and automated solution for managing PostgreSQL stored procedures using a Lambda function.”

Biased evaluations aren’t a deviation from expected behavior. They are expected. How did they initially confirm this AI was safe to deploy? It's misleading to label this an incident.
