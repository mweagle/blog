“What about things (i.e., tasks or activities) your team need to do to realize the objective and key results? Key results are outcomes your stakeholders want to see. Those are generally fixed. You might change or refine the activities when the going gets tough, but should generally keep the goals and key results the same.”

“We had a problem. After years of "Agile Transformation" followed by rolling out the Scaled Agile Framework, we were not delivering any better. In fact, we delivered less frequently with bigger failures than when we had no defined processes. We had to find a way to deliver better value to the business. SAFe, with all of the ceremonies and process overhead that comes with it, wasn’t getting that done.”

What was the way?

“Relentlessly overcoming the problems that prevent frequent delivery also lowers process overhead and the cost of change. That, in turn, makes it economically more attractive to try new ideas and get feedback instead of just hoping your investment returns results. You don’t need SAFe’s PI planning when you have product roadmaps and teams that handle dependencies with code.”

To make things faster, start with known hotspots and channel Brendan Gregg:

Don't do it

Do it, but don't do it again

Do it less

Do it later

Do it when they're not looking

Do it concurrently

Do it cheaper

“But outcomes are avoided for a reason: they are often harder to set and to achieve, they require major changes in the way the org thinks and acts, and they’re not at all natural or intuitive. Outcome goals are such a big challenge that some question the entire concept.”

Problem: “The researchers also found that ChatGPT-generated code did have a fair amount of vulnerabilities, such as a missing null test, but many of these were easily fixable.”

Proposal: “Tangs says, based on these results, it’s important that developers using ChatGPT provide additional information to help ChatGPT better understand problems or avoid vulnerabilities.”

“Easily”, “important” and “understand” are doing a lot of work.
