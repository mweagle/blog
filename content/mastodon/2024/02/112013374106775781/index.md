<p>&quot;To all the recruiters in the world: The truth is, while some of you are certainly predatory and untrustworthy, I firmly believe the majority of you aren&#39;t trying to take advantage of anybody. That&#39;s the good news. The bad news is, we still don&#39;t trust you. And the main reason we don&#39;t trust you is because we don&#39;t trust your process.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://blogs.newardassociates.com/blog/2024/recruiting-process-thoughts.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">http://</span><span class="ellipsis">blogs.newardassociates.com/blo</span><span class="invisible">g/2024/recruiting-process-thoughts.html</span></a></p>
