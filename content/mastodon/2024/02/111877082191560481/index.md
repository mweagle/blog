<p>&quot;Companies should adopt an intentional and regular gathering strategy for all employees to connect routinely.&quot;</p><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/qhamirani/2024/01/26/ceos-are-using-return-to-office-mandates-to-mask-poor-management" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">forbes.com/sites/qhamirani/202</span><span class="invisible">4/01/26/ceos-are-using-return-to-office-mandates-to-mask-poor-management</span></a></p>

<p>I agree with this sentiment and the hard work is turning physical proximity into beneficial outcomes...for both the *people* and their *work together.* </p><p>Putting zero-sum, closed-minded, toxic, prejudiced and generally unpleasant people together will not magically produce better results. Although it&#39;s guaranteed to encourage people with different values to start looking for new organizations.</p>

<p>Westrum&#39;s organizational model observations (<a href="https://itrevolution.com/articles/westrums-organizational-model-in-tech-orgs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">itrevolution.com/articles/west</span><span class="invisible">rums-organizational-model-in-tech-orgs/</span></a>) embrace location transparency. It&#39;s just as easy to shoot the messenger over Slack as it is over a conference table. </p><p>RTO mandates only affect the exposure profile, not the risk of exposure.</p>

<p>Physical proximity does provide more secondary signals for juniors about what&#39;s normal and acceptable. It also *can* reduce the communication costs and social anxiety around asking learning questions.</p><p>But it can just as easily signal that their questions are &quot;Googleable&quot; and &quot;something they should know&quot;. Plus, evolution has equipped us with diverse facial recognition and body language reading skills.</p>

<p>TL;DR: It was/still is a pandemic, not a normal &quot;distributed team&quot; environment. Values and behaviors can be expressed in many different ways. An office is a place, not a gateway to an alternative universe.</p>
