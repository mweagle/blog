<p>Good reason for pairing/working in proximity with a partner. Juniors onboarding understandably miss silent signals. They won&#39;t even realize they should ask a senior because there&#39;s no event to which they should react.</p><p>&quot;Novices don‚Äôt know what is typical, so they have a hard time identifying what is atypical. Experts can quickly spot unusual events and detect deviations. And, they are able to notice when something that ought to happen, doesn‚Äôt.&quot;</p><p><a href="https://commoncog.com/an-easier-method-for-extracting-tacit-knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">commoncog.com/an-easier-method</span><span class="invisible">-for-extracting-tacit-knowledge/</span></a></p>

<p>This communication gap is widened in distributed environments. Expecting juniors to immediately setup a video call with a senior asking &quot;hey, I have no idea what&#39;s going on and there is no data&quot; can be a delicate topic and expectation. Depending on the organization, that behavior can either signal &quot;proactively reaches out to unblock progress&quot; or &quot;fails to deeply investigate issues&quot;.</p>
