<p>Remembering the time I went to the office and I was one of two people wearing masks. A person from another team, sitting across the monitor from me (open floorplan, edge to edge desks lengthwise), was taking video calls most of the day from their desk. My monitor faced the primary hallway which was ~6 feet behind my back so I couldn‚Äôt work on docs that might be sensitive. </p><p>I later reserved an entire conference room just for me to work.  Like an extra large office.</p>
