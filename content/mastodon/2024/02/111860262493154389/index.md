<p>“Backlogs grow without bound unless they are culled. 1000 tickets is the same as 100 tickets, except that you haven’t identified which 10% are most important. Which means you’re definitely not working on the most important ones. But if you delete things, it will sometimes turn out we needed to do it after all.”</p><p><a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/good-problems-to-have/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">longform.asmartbear.com/good-p</span><span class="invisible">roblems-to-have/</span></a></p>
