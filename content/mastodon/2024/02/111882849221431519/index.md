<p>The words ‚Äúwrong&quot; and &quot;careful&quot; are doing a tremendous amount of heavy lifting in this sentence:</p><p>&quot;Calibration has so far been studied in non generative (e.g., classification) settings, especially in Software Engineering. However, generated code can quite often be wrong: Developers need to know when they should e.g., directly use, use after careful review, or discard model-generated code.‚Äù </p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02047" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="">arxiv.org/abs/2402.02047</span><span class="invisible"></span></a></p>

<p>Given the oracle is known unreliable, this seems odd. </p><p>&quot;We consider...reflective probability, obtained by re-invoking the model, prompting it to estimate how confident it is in the correctness of of the code it had just generated (See Figure 1).&quot;</p>
