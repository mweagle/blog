<p>Flooding the Zone was a strategy, not an ideal.</p><p>I&#39;m stumbling around trying to form a prompt that will produce responses that only reference the input text (temperature=0). It&#39;s like an immensely frustrating text adventure game without the ability to introspect. There are no semantic level errors, so the only way I know it may have worked (not failed?) is to review each response.</p>

<p>Sending prompts and ignoring the quality of responses scales in the same way that <a href="https://devnull-as-a-service.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="">devnull-as-a-service.com/</span><span class="invisible"></span></a> scales. </p><p>It&#39;s very easy to generate a lot, but very little is guaranteed to be worth generating.</p>
