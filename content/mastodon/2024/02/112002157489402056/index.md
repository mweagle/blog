<p>‚ÄúHuman engineers will still have to evaluate and review the code that an AI writes. But they&#39;ll now have to do it without the benefit of having anyone who understands it. No one can explain it. No one can explain what they were thinking when they wrote it. No one can explain what they expect it to do.
