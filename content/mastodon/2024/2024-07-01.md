â€œThe goal at each step is gathering feedback fast and cheap. Youâ€™re not trying to invest in these increments, youâ€™re trying to avoid investing until you are more certain that a payoff is likely.â€

Louder for anyone who just entered. Activities are the way, but they are not the destination.

â€œThat's because these data are activity-based measuresâ€¦I don't know why the project managers are tracking any of these, because all of these measures are meaningless. Sure, they're easy to collect, but they offer no value in clarifying the reality of the project's progress.â€

â€œThis quadrant, which has high autonomy and low focus, is about engineering leaders pushing it and wanting to maximize their potential but lacking the connection to the business. This was very common during the ZIRP days when raising VC money was extremely easy. Thus, tech executives had a lot of leeway and could do this sort of â€œperformative leadershipâ€ without having to justify their actions.â€

Own the problem, not the solution. Build the system to discover the solution.

â€œDefining clear metrics tied to business goals is a hurdle, with many teams neglecting to gather baseline data before deployment or reassess progress periodically. The importance of incorporating employee feedback is often underestimated, hindering continuous improvement efforts.â€

At the start of a project, when we know the least, assume the best, and are often pressured to deliver, is the worst time to define long term timelines. Anchoring on the optimistic future despite a glaring absence of future evidence.

â€œAnchoring is another type of cognitive bias that plays a big role in the planning fallacy.â€
