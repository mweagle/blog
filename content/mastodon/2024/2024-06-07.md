“In practice, I tend to find that you only really want two log levels: ERROR and INFO. That's because we really do only care if something should alert us or not. For all the other uses of logs, we want to see all the context.”

“So, every time AI is asked to revise an image, it either starts over or makes it more and more of a disaster. People who work with AI-generated imagery have to adapt their creative vision to what comes out of the system - or go in with a mentality that anything that fits the brief is good enough.”

This is referencing customer, product, and business language communities. IME it often applies equally well to friction between dev, sec, and SRE.

“Conflicts happen when one party applies their language to a party that is using a different language. It doesn’t translate automatically. So it’s up to us to create systems that not only translate, but that help achieve each others’ goals.”

I need to use something other than `AI: ` in my notes. 🤔

This template could benefit from a  “CW: Omniscience”.

“Overall, the whole event felt a bit like sitting in a time machine back to the early 2000s and before. People only considered increasing efficiency. It did not come to anyone’s mind at all that improving their effectiveness could offer a much bigger lever.”

This is a great deconstruction of scaling. Scalability is a multidimensional concept.  Collapsing it to a maximum point of workload density ignores many of the most business important reasons for distributing work.

“Changes. Perhaps the most universal requirement in systems, and one that is frequently overlooked, is the ability to deal with change.”
