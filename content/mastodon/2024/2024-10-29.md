“It’s not just the crushing misinterpretation of the Agile manifesto or the constant stop-start-stop pace of Scrum or the horrible micromanagement UX of Jira turning product management back into project management. Over the past couple of years, it’s become a misinterpretation of the product role itself.”

This is not a good bet.

"What might be surprising — at least to engineering leadership that is betting whole DevEx budgets on AI — is that results are still mixed.”

Ballmer voice: customers, customers customers….

Who are you creating for, what do they want to achieve, how can you help them?

"The 2023 DORA report found that a greater user centricity led to a staggering 40% increase in organizational performance.

This year’s report found that organizations that prioritize the end user experience not only produce higher quality products, but these organizations’ developers are more productive, more satisfied and less likely to experience burnout.”

[@DaveMasonDotMe](https://mastodon.social/@DaveMasonDotMe) I also think broadly the market incentivized title inflation ("You could get fired for your own incompetence and find a new role within weeks - with a better title and salary to boot.”) for compensation bands.

IME, it's incredibly difficult to deliver senior-eng level impact in a new organization in less than a year, maybe even two. Those projects typically require lots of organizational context, alignment, and staged x-team deliverables.

[@DaveMasonDotMe](https://mastodon.social/@DaveMasonDotMe) I don't know, although I suspect there aren't a lot of places that can fund 60k engineers in waiting to preserve optionality.

I think taking ownership of your team's outcomes, representing your people fairly and accurately, and providing business value is generally good.

“I’ve covered good engineers in detail. But what makes a great engineer? Great engineers do all of the above but proactively. If they see a broken process, they don’t walk past the problem or wait for someone else’s permission. They take action to fix it.”

“This is the existential threat that CTOs now face. The scary thing is that most of them don’t even realize it - they’re still operating like it’s 2015, where the goal is hiring and retention. They’re strolling into conversations with their CFOs on ‘productivity’ with developer sentiment surveys in hand.”
