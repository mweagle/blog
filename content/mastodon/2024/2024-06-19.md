“We introduce AGILECODER, a novel multi-agent software development framework inspired by Agile methodology, which emphasizes effective communication and incremental development among agents. This framework allows for the inheritance of outputs across sprints, enabling continuous refinement and increasing the success likelihood of the final products.”

<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11912>

“AgileCoder integrates Agile Methodology into a multi-agent system framework, enabling a collaborative environment where software agents assume specific Agile roles such as Product Owner, Developer, Reviewer, and Tester. These agents work together to develop software efficiently and iteratively, simulating a dynamic and adaptive software development team.”

“The information processing (IP) metaphor of human intelligence now dominates human thinking, both on the street and in the sciences. There is virtually no form of discourse about intelligent human behaviour that proceeds without employing this metaphor, just as no form of discourse about intelligent human behaviour could proceed in certain eras and cultures without reference to a spirit or deity.”

“A group itself does not represent a team, for a group to become a team, there is a need for a common goal. As a group evolves into a team, it needs to go through several transformations.”

What are the current goals and metrics that junior developers are responding to such that ShadowAI is enticing? If those metrics index on short term output and not understanding or team effectiveness, why would they be introduced?

“Executives should explicitly define goals and metrics, provide training and keep the lines of communication open throughout the adoption process, Forrester recommends. “
