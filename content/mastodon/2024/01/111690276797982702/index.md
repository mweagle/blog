<p>“With that settled up, let&#39;s take a look at what I think will happen across calendar year 2024. As I&#39;ve done with my predictions, I&#39;m including a probability score with each one, in much the same way intelligence officials do in their assessment reports, to give you a sense of how confident I am in the prediction.”</p><p><a href="http://blogs.newardassociates.com/blog/2024/2024-tech-predictions.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">http://</span><span class="ellipsis">blogs.newardassociates.com/blo</span><span class="invisible">g/2024/2024-tech-predictions.html</span></a></p>

<p>From a personal perspective, optimistic this prediction is on point:</p><p>“But with the new year, and a bit of optimism in the market, they&#39;ll start growing new branches to that tree, and that will require more in the way of engineering management and &quot;ancillary units&quot; like developer relations, R&amp;D, and so on. It&#39;ll take a while, and it&#39;ll never be like 2019, but before too long things will get stronger.”</p>
