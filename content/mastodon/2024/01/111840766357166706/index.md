<p>Roofing with a power nailer makes this type of issue more likely. Feedback is both quicker and less frequent vs. driving a nail with a hammer. It&#39;s *very* obvious using hand tools when I miss sinking the nail into the rafter.</p><p>But the owner can&#39;t see the difference from the outside. It‚Äôs ‚Äúdone‚Äù and the worker using the power nailer probably was ‚Äúmore productive&quot; installing the roof than me with a hammer. </p><p>However, there are windstorms in the forecast. </p><p>Related: <a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/Articles/2024/01/25/copilot-research.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">visualstudiomagazine.com/Artic</span><span class="invisible">les/2024/01/25/copilot-research.aspx</span></a></p>
