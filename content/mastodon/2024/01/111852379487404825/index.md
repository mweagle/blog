<p>Good survey paper that includes ethical considerations (&quot;neutral&quot; demographic data is biased) and the importance of interpretability for ML deployments. </p><p>&quot;Many pain points we have described in this work were already experienced by communities in these fields, and the ML community should turn to them for solutions and inspiration.‚Äù</p><p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3533378" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="">dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3533378</span><span class="invisible"></span></a></p>

<p>This closing observation highlights the distance between theory and practice:</p><p>&quot;As an observation that follows from the process of collecting papers to review in this survey, we note the relative shortage of deployment experience reports in the academic literature.‚Äù</p>
