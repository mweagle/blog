<p>&quot;What I love about consistency models is that they aren‚Äôt treated as correctness models. Instead, they‚Äôre weirdness models: different levels of consistency will violate our intuitions relative to linearizability, and we need to choose what level of weirdness that we can actually implement and that is good enough for our application.‚Äù</p><p><a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2023/12/29/the-inherent-weirdness-of-system-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">surfingcomplexity.blog/2023/12</span><span class="invisible">/29/the-inherent-weirdness-of-system-behavior/</span></a></p>
