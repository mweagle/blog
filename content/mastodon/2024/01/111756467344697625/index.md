<p>Do you/your team have closed-loop mechanisms already in place to understand whether your technical/functional changes have business impact? Eg: commit-tracking, staged/phased deploys, feature-flags, A/B testing, multiple concurrent cohort anonymized data tracking, data lake/mesh, reporting pipelines, time series analysis w/stat significance, BI metrics, etc.? </p><p>Eg: could a developer track the business impact of their single commit over time?</p>
