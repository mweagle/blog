<p>Adding to this insight - naming something and associating it with a larger (potentially measurable) outcome can create space for the team to propose new ideas. It can help move conversation from output based (close the known tickets) to outcome based (increase NPS score, closing the tickets as a byproduct).  It may cause new work items to be created - some of which may completely obsolete the known ones.</p>
