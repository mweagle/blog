<p>&quot;So maybe a decision didn‚Äôt go your way. Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of a roomful of straw and you need to give this to your team to build meaningful things from. They are not going to like being given straw. So I recommend spinning it into gold first before presenting it to the team.‚Äù</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/bbc-product-technology/things-i-have-learned-about-tech-leadership-5efcf94065ca" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">medium.com/bbc-product-technol</span><span class="invisible">ogy/things-i-have-learned-about-tech-leadership-5efcf94065ca</span></a></p>
