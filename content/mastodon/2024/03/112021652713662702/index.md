<p>This observation intersects with AI&#39;s narrative about automating production of visible work, while ignoring the much larger work context.</p><p>&quot;It‚Äôs distressingly common for bureaucratized systems to focus on a minute subset of an organization‚Äôs problems. Generally, these efforts are directed at improving the workers‚Äô performance via objectives, performance reviews, and rankings. Unfortunately, this focus is often misplaced because the workers form only a fraction of the overall problems.&quot;</p>
