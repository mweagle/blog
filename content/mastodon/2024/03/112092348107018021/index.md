<p>Assume we‚Äôll deliver the first version. We will (even if doesn‚Äôt feel likely or even possible). That version was our best guess at understanding the problem.</p><p>How will we know whether the next versions move us in the preferred direction?  How will we know if things are trending in an undesirable direction? </p><p>Answer those questions before delivering the first version.</p>
