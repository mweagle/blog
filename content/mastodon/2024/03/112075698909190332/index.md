<p>Coming up on the 2025 horizon for these 2014 predictions about AI, robotics and the Future of Jobs. </p><p>Interesting to read how many people thought autonomous vehicles were both (1) technologically imminent and (2) would be rapidly integrated into society. </p><p><a href="https://policycommons.net/artifacts/619693/ai-robotics-and-the-future-of-jobs/1600846/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">policycommons.net/artifacts/61</span><span class="invisible">9693/ai-robotics-and-the-future-of-jobs/1600846/</span></a></p>

<p>Daren C. Brabham, assistant professor at the Annenberg School for Communication &amp; Journalism, University of Southern California, wrote, “It is a long-standing sci-fi fantasy that someday our advances in automation/AI/robots will make human labor obsolete and allow us to live happier, healthier lives of leisure.
