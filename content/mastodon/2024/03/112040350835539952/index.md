<p>&quot;When I generally ask people the question of ‚ÄúWhat level of maturity do you want to be one year from now as an organization or team?‚Äù, most people by default respond they wish to be at Level 3(Proactive). I want to caution that not all teams and organizations have to be at Level 3 to be successful as a product.&quot;</p><p><a href="https://icchasethi.medium.com/operational-health-maturity-model-ea6491a39c6e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">icchasethi.medium.com/operatio</span><span class="invisible">nal-health-maturity-model-ea6491a39c6e</span></a></p>
