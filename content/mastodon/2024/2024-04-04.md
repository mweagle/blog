“1. Understand the real-world problem.

2. Analyze it from a software point of view.

3. Imagine a solution.

4. Align a team on the problem, the solution, and the values that shape the solution.

5. Coordinate to express that understanding in code.

6. Get feedback and iterate.

7. SHIP IT.”

“If you read the story, it becomes obvious that the key vulnerability wasn’t technical, it was the fact that a whole lot of Open-Source software is on the undermaintained-to-neglected axis, because there’s no business case for paying people to take care of it. Which is a problem, because there is a strong business case for paying people to attack it.“

Anyways, this reminded me of the XZ exploit, the problem of measuring platform team impact, allocating sustaining engineering, ops work being relegated to junior team members, and the allure of One More Feature.

“Infrastructural systems are famously boring because the best possible outcome is nothing happening, or at least nothing unexpected or untoward. But nothing happens, and nothing continues to happen, as a result of sufficient attention, specialized care, and unceasing oversight.”
