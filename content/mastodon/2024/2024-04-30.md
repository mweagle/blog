“These are risks stemming from misalignment between a company’s economic incentives to profit from its proprietary AI model in a particular way and society’s interests in how the AI model should be monetised and deployed.

The surest way to ignore such misalignment is by focusing exclusively on technical questions about AI model capabilities, divorced from the socio-economic environment in which these models will operate and be designed for profit.”

Every team is cognitively distributed, some teams sometimes have people physically near each other.

“THE BIGGEST BENEFIT OF EMBRACING REMOTE WORK IS ALSO THE REASON THAT REMOTE WORK SUCKS.

A remote culture forces operational practices that benefit the people you serve—employees, customers, investors.”

Alternative take: users have no standard way to understand a product’s security posture and whether that posture is continually maintained. What would a “product recall due to internal security issue” look like for software?

“Users have a remarkably low baseline for caring about security.”

I agree with this 100%

“I have to bear some bad news: the way you feel about remote meetings is the way some of your coworkers feel about every meeting. The remote meeting isn’t the cause of the problem: rather, the unwritten caucus rule is the cause of the problem, and remoteness happens to exacerbate that problem to the point that even people with high caucus scores notice the friction.”

“Given a GitHub repo or a specific bug within a repo, Workspace — underpinned by OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo model — can build a plan to (attempt to) squash the bug or implement a new feature, drawing on an understanding of the repo’s comments, issue replies and larger codebase”
