“We focus on understanding the problem as a team, documenting the work required and eliminating our uncertainties by breaking the work down into queues of tasks.

All of our time spent planning produces output that is both useful and reliable.”

“So I don’t want to say that every time it is possible to improve things with coaching. If someone doesn’t want to improve and is not motivated by the role and the company, they may simply not be the right person for your team.”
