“One way to get people to go from agreeing it should happen to actually doing the work is to get buy-in. When you have buy-in, people will actively work toward the goal instead of just agreeing to it. Getting buy-in is hard.”

“Another important detail is the role of the "Chief Engineer" (or "Shusa" in Japanese) in TPS. The Chief Engineer is accountable for the entire product development process, provides vision and direction, has a customer focus, integrates work across various cross-functional teams, is a technical expert, has decision-making authority, is a strong mentor and role model, and is generally a respected individual.”

“They want an "AI and Automation" lead specifically, looking for someone that has extensive experience with machine learning and PowerApps, two things that have basically no overlap. The former is a domain so broad as for that requirement to be useless, and the latter is a strong indicator in industry that your team doesn't know how to engineer.”
