“Now that we’re inside the run function, we can go back to writing normal Go code where we can return errors like it’s nobody’s business. We gophers just love returning errors, and the sooner we admit that to ourselves, the sooner those people on the internet can win and go away.”

“Although Generative AI and LLMs have led to a paradigm shift in the methods we use to direct or restrict language models to achieve specific functionalities, what hasn’t changed is the fundamental value of Lean product engineering practices.”

"At another company, an AI resume screener had been trained on CVs of employees already at the firm, giving people extra marks if they listed "baseball" or "basketball" – hobbies that were linked to more successful staff, often men.
