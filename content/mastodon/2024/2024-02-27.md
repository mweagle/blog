“This example highlights a second straw man that I will set up and then knock down: That security is uniquely hard because you have to get it right over and over again, at every layer of the system.

Of course the same is true of every other system requirement.’

“Human engineers will still have to evaluate and review the code that an AI writes. But they'll now have to do it without the benefit of having anyone who understands it. No one can explain it. No one can explain what they were thinking when they wrote it. No one can explain what they expect it to do. Every choice made in writing software is a choice not to do things in a different way. “

“If we get paid for everything we do that has value, then it also means everything becomes our job. That’s how you end up neck-deep in hustle culture, with passive income bros recording TikTok videos about the latest way to make it rich with 15 minutes of work per day. That is the blockchain casino.”

Can confirm.

“In many cases, verifying that an AI has done its work correctly may be as difficult as it would be for a human to do the work in the first place. This process is often called “critical thinking,” but it goes a lot deeper: it requires scrutinizing every fact and every logical inference, even the most self-evident and obvious.”

“The elimination of dependencies, it turns out, is precisely the thing that holds up most teams, which (as any architect knows) is also the same principles around how to get the most throughput from a scalable system. "The enemy of scalability is contention." The more often a process has to content for a shared resource, the worse the performance curve gets.”

“We have no strong measurements on resilience for an organization, where it starts/stops, and how to fully justify the resilience after the fact. This is an excellent time to remind folks that I am not in sales.”

Been using LangChain and Chat GPT to analyze a corpus of text (<https://info.arxiv.org/help/bulk_data.html>). I'm taking PDFs, extracting the plaintext per-page and querying for something like "No more than N sentences that reference concept X".

It *seems* to do ok with general sentiment and fails to extract sentences that are related to the concept. It happily returns sentences that a human reader would consider unrelated.

To "debug", I try the interactive chat version to see if I can understand why certain sentences are returned.

It initially respected limiting responses to the input text. It acknowledged its error (?) and understandably couldn't explain why a specific sentence was included.

The refined sentences were not accurate, so I followed up with a request to limit responses to the input text only.

It then started to include sentences that did not exist in the text at all.

Giving up now - maybe there's a "magic prompt" I should be using, but I have no clue how to find it.
