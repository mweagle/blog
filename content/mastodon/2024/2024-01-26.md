"So, friends, if you are talking to a compiler engineer, by all means: keep describing WebAssembly as an virtual machine. It will keep them interested. But for everyone else, the value of WebAssembly is what it does, which is to be a different way of breaking a system into pieces."

"Having been coached on incremental prompting to improve results, another student remarked that it took about the same amount of time to coax a good enough essay from the chatbot as to write his original essay."

Exploring <https://linear.app> and their focus on keyboard accessibility and compatibility with other tools is excellent. Ctrl+[ / ] does exactly what you’d expect.

I don't know how well it works with screen readers, but I do wish similarly interactive sites were as keyboard-friendly and responsive.

This is a good set of Principles and Practices, including:

"Decide and move on

There isn't always a best answer. The important thing is to make a decision, and move on.”

I’ve also phrased this as, “Since we can't prove that our decision will be right, what's our shortest path to produce evidence that confirms/denies our hypothesis?"
