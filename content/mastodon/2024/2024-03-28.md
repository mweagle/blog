Posted a WIP tool that takes a JSON network of PERT & Pareto generators (YAML maybe in the future), runs them through a Monte Carlo, and then produces a network image with the p50 critical path highlighted: <https://github.com/mweagle/goestimate>.

Along the way I learned about D2 for text to diagrams (<https://d2lang.com/>) and switched away from Graphviz.
