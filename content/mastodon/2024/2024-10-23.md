“The thing is, certain decision-making pitfalls have limited negative impact at the “line programmer” level…They become less lovable as the gearheads get more power, though, and those pitfalls produce a larger impact crater. Three in particular come up repeatedly and cause projects to falter or fail. Let’s go over them.”

“In 2020 and 2021, Ross got between 30 and 80 applications for job openings that he was tasked to fill as hiring manager, such as front-end engineer or data scientist. Over the last year, he received anywhere from 400 to 1,000 applications for each position.”

This is a good process.

“An established process: As the researchers put it:

“We automate things where we are able, we provide templates and examples where we can’t automate, and (regardless) we write everything down”.”

“The “long build” problem is unfortunately common. We’ve talked with many organizations that experience fresh build times in the 2+ hour range. Large teams are particularly impacted – Graphite reports that the P75 total CI time for teams with over 50 engineers is a whopping 130 minutes…”

“Most people are heavily biased by their own experience, are inclined to credit skill rather than luck, brilliance rather than being in a position to be in the right place at the right time. It’s easy to tell a story about how you did the right things when the numbers were going up, and it’s hard to know what worked and what didn’t when the numbers are going down.”
