Considering the "impact" of an IC institutionalizes Outcome Bias as an evaluation criteria. Outcomes typically aren't within the agency of a single person. And even if they were, does the organization have isolated feedback mechanisms to which an IC could respond? Is it even possible for a person to understand the effect of their engineering decisions from last year's Q2?
