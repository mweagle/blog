I don't know if this is new behavior with Sequoia...I've noticed that when I maximize windows now they are no longer flush with the menu bar. There is a gap through which the background renders, so it looks like there's a tear in the screen. Not distracting at all.

@petersforbes@sigmoid.social Yep. I can imagine juniors using it because documentation is lacking and LLMs are non-judgmental. Going from zero to anything is a major win.

I can also envision senior ICs realizing that the questions they're asking are much more complex & context-rich. The proposed changes may also induce systemic failures-at-a-distance that aren't LLM friendly.

“For a while it was suggested that remote work would create difficulties for new hires. But four years on, the opposite is true – many younger workers have never experienced the five-day-a-week office and may have difficulty adjusting to it.”

Agree - although helping juniors develop requires communication. There are ambient physical signals and passive sharing that happens when people are together. It takes intentionality to mimic these in purely distributed environments.

Libraries have discovery systems and stable locations. They’re not just empty buildings with terminals running Teams/Slack/Discord.

People are notoriously bad at exactly this type of work. There will be an expectation of increased output with stable or greater quality. When that doesn’t prove out, people distant from the sharp end of work may fall back to a fundamental attribution bias. That will only make things worse.

“Generative AI has been shown to improve productivity, especially by automating repetitive tasks. However, usage continues to prove that human oversight is critical to its success.”

IIUC, Go is a language created to serve large scale software development for a specific domain. malloc doesn’t scale.

“Go is a language created by people who had nothing left to prove.”

“Every reorg is a trade-off. It makes some things easier and some things harder. It’s important to be aware of what needs to be easier and what needs to get harder in your own business model, which is influenced by talent pool, budget, competition, etc.”

“The "knowing-doing gap" refers to the disconnect between what people know—such as leadership theories or best practices—and what they actually implement in their day-to-day work. This gap is particularly relevant in leadership roles, where understanding leadership principles doesn’t always translate into effective action.”
