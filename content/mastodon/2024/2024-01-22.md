I really like OmniGroup software, but oh no...

"With OmniPlan for Apple Vision Pro, your Gantt charts are no longer limited by the size of a physical display screen. How cool is that?”

Richart Rumelt perfectly summarizes the tension between reality and the desire for organizational predictability.

"Now it's called insight, and insight is scary. It's scary because it's not guaranteed to happen. We want to innovate, but we're scared of insight. We want to be the first, but we'd like to pick our strategy out of a list of common strategies for being first. We want to beat the market, but we don't want to study enough to have an insight.”

"It doesn't always come when we want it to. It can come while you're driving the car, it can come the next day. It can come in the shower."

Lenny's Podcast has a great interview with Richard Rumelt.

“A set of goals. Goals are the engineering of how companies work to some extent. But abstract, high-level goals, they're not strategy, they're something else. They're ambitions. And ambitions are not a strategy. A list of all the different things you wish would happen is not strategy.”

"And I gradually came to the realization all strategy is problem solving. It's a form of dealing with challenges, and that was a basic idea going in the book. So if that's the core of it, what's the basic activity? What are you doing when you create a strategy? Well, you're diagnosing the situation. You're trying to figure out what's going on here. What's the nature of reality that you're dealing with?”
