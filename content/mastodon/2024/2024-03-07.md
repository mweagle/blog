“Their nifty technologies make teams more efficient, and allow them to do more with less. But it turns out, the managers of those teams don’t want to do more with less. They want to do more with more!”

Pt 2….

“ When I asked ChatGPT to write me a Quarkus PanacheEntity, I was initally delighted with how much code it produced. “Wow,” I thought, “it would have taken me ages to write that much code!” But when I looked closer at the code, I realised I wouldn’t have written that much code, because the code didn’t need to be there.”

“This is one reason why 99% of goal setting fails in the first 6 months. Most of the goal setting is around outcomes, but not around setting the processes and systems that will ensure that we do in fact get there.

Visualizing processes is also proven in research as being more effective compared to only visualizing outcomes. [3] Visualizing “how can I do it” rather than “I can do it”. [9]”

“One reason to take a slower approach is that assessments of productivity typically focus on the task level — summarizing a document, completing a slide deck, or answering a customer call, for example — and how individuals might use and benefit from LLMs. Using such findings to draw broad conclusions about firm-level performance could prove costly.”

“Every meeting invite should contain:

•	A clear goal / expected outcome of the meeting

•	An idea of why an invitee is invited to the meeting, down to the most granular level possible.

•	Exactly what discussion points you intend to cover”

Prefer operationalizing a product rather than a technology.

“To fulfill these myriad tasks, many large companies are heralding a new job title: Large Language Model Operations, or LLMOps, which includes prompt engineering in its lifecycle but also entails all the other tasks needed to deploy the product.”
