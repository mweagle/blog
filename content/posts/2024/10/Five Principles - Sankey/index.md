## Five Principles of Human Performance - Sankey Edition

This is an [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) version of the original [Five Principles]({{< ref "/posts/2024/01/principlesofhop/index.md" >}} "Five Principles") post.  I created this version primarily as an opportunity to write some code and play around with the different charts.

I'll describe the shortcode configuration in another post.

## Sankey Version

{{< echarts id="fiveprinciples" width="1200px" height="1200px" srcChart="content/posts/2024/10/Five Principles - Sankey/chart.js">}}
{{< /echarts >}}
