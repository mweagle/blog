Hi Timoti — it’s taken a bit longer than expected &amp; Sparta 0.11.0 now supports Python as the shim layer for improved performance. Python/cgo is an optional target and doesn’t require significant developer side changes. See [http://gosparta.io/docs/cgo/](http://gosparta.io/docs/cgo/) for more information. Appreciate the feedback — thanks!
