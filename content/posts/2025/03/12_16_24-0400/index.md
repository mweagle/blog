I've been playing around with Rust and installed [Codeium](https://codeium.com) as a VSCode Extension. It's been surprisingly helpful. Having a context-aware, VSCode integrated panel  helped reduce app context switching.  My habits are hard to break and I initially found myself Googling for answers looking up Makefile syntax or `git` submodules. I switched to using Codeium and it provided helpful responses.  Plus, the responses included syntax highlighted text ready for copying.

I haven't configured anything and at least out of box, it's very overzealous during inline autocomplete and suggests invalid code. I also use multi-select to update parenthesis and brackets, which creates some really unwieldy multi-token expansions. I'll keep messing around with it and see what options it exposes.
