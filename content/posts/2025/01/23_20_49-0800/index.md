I installed [Codeium](https://codeium.com) as a VSCode Extension and it's pretty helpful. It was really convenient to have inline help that I could ask context specific questions. Topics like Git submodule configuration, Makefile syntax, and similar things. I still found myself Googling questions. When I realized this I went back to Codeium and was surprised how accurate the responses were.

I haven't configured anything and at least out of box, it's overzealous during inline autocomplete. I also use multi-select to update parenthesis and brackets, which creates some really unwieldy multi-token expansions along the way. Hopefully there's a configuration option.
