## Hugo Shortcode with C4 Plant UML themes

The [C4 Model](https://c4model.com) is a way to hierarchically and visually describe software. In their own words:

> The C4 model was created as a way to help software development teams describe and communicate software architecture, both during up-front design sessions and when retrospectively documenting an existing codebase.

It's an approach to visualize Context, Containers, Components, and Code (the 4Cs).

I wrote [C4-PlantUML-Themes](https://github.com/mweagle/C4-PlantUML-Themes) which a short script that autogenerates a set of customizable themes autogenerated from ColorBrewer and Seaborn palettes. See the C4-Plant UML [Themes](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/blob/master/Themes.md) page for more information on the variables set by each theme.

Thanks to [Paul Dugas](https://paul.dugas.cc/post/plantuml-shortcode/) for the [Hugo shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) that allows me to embed the PlantUML files and render them with some fancy JavaScript.

The following [sample diagrams](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/blob/master/samples/C4CoreDiagrams.md) are styled with the [Seaborn Magma](https://github.com/mweagle/C4-PlantUML-Themes#puml-theme-seaborn_magma_9puml) colors.
